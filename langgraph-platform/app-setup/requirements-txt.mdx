python-dotenv>=1.0.0
```

## Installation

Install the dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Additional Dependencies

Depending on your needs, you might want to add these optional dependencies:

```txt
langgraph-platform[streaming]  # For streaming support
langgraph-platform[hitl]       # For human-in-the-loop features
langgraph-platform[webhooks]   # For webhook support
```

## Version Management
