A single agent might struggle if it needs to specialize in multiple domains or manage many tools. To tackle this, you can break your agent into smaller, independent agents and composing them into a [multi-agent system](/oss/javascript/multi-agent).

In multi-agent systems, agents need to communicate between each other. They do so via [handoffs](#handoffs) — a primitive that describes which agent to hand control to and the payload to send to that agent.

This guide covers the following:

* implementing [handoffs](#handoffs) between agents
* using handoffs and the prebuilt [agent](/oss/javascript/prebuilts) to [build a custom multi-agent system](#build-a-multi-agent-system)

To get started with building multi-agent systems, check out LangGraph [prebuilt implementations](#prebuilt-implementations) of two of the most popular multi-agent architectures — [supervisor](/oss/javascript/multi-agent-prebuilts#supervisor) and [swarm](/oss/javascript/multi-agent-prebuilts#swarm).

## Handoffs

To set up communication between the agents in a multi-agent system you can use [**handoffs**](/oss/javascript/multi-agent#handoffs) — a pattern where one agent *hands off* control to another. Handoffs allow you to specify:

* **destination**: target agent to navigate to (e.g., name of the LangGraph node to go to)
* **payload**: information to pass to that agent (e.g., state update)

### Create handoffs

To implement handoffs, you can return `Command` objects from your agent nodes or tools:



```typescript
import { tool } from "@langchain/core/tools";
import { Command, MessagesZodState } from "@langchain/langgraph";
import { z } from "zod";

function createHandoffTool({
  agentName,
  description,
}: {
  agentName: string;
  description?: string;
}) {
  const name = `transfer_to_${agentName}`;
  const toolDescription = description || `Transfer to ${agentName}`;

  return tool(
    async (_, config) => {
      // (1)!
      const state = config.state;
      const toolCallId = config.toolCall.id;

      const toolMessage = {
        role: "tool" as const,
        content: `Successfully transferred to ${agentName}`,
        name: name,
        tool_call_id: toolCallId,
      };

      return new Command({
        // (3)!
        goto: agentName,
        // (4)!
        update: { messages: [...state.messages, toolMessage] },
        // (5)!
        graph: Command.PARENT,
      });
    },
    {
      name,
      description: toolDescription,
      schema: z.object({}),
    }
  );
}
```

1. Access the [state](/oss/javascript/graph-api#state) of the agent that is calling the handoff tool through the `config` parameter.
2. The `Command` primitive allows specifying a state update and a node transition as a single operation, making it useful for implementing handoffs.
3. Name of the agent or node to hand off to.
4. Take the agent's messages and **add** them to the parent's **state** as part of the handoff. The next agent will see the parent state.
5. Indicate to LangGraph that we need to navigate to agent node in a **parent** multi-agent graph.

<Tip>
  If you want to use tools that return `Command`, you can either use prebuilt [`create_react_agent`](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraphjs/reference/functions/langgraph_prebuilt.createReactAgent.html) / [`ToolNode`](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraphjs/reference/classes/langgraph_prebuilt.ToolNode.html) components, or implement your own tool-executing node that collects `Command` objects returned by the tools and returns a list of them, e.g.:
  
  ```typescript
  const callTools = async (state) => {
    // ...
    const commands = await Promise.all(
      toolCalls.map(toolCall => toolsByName[toolCall.name].invoke(toolCall))
    );
    return commands;
  };
  ```
</Tip>


<Warning>
This handoff implementation assumes that:

* each agent receives overall message history (across all agents) in the multi-agent system as its input. If you want more control over agent inputs, see [this section](#control-agent-inputs)
* each agent outputs its internal messages history to the overall message history of the multi-agent system. If you want more control over **how agent outputs are added**, wrap the agent in a separate node function:

```javascript {highlight={5}}
const callHotelAssistant = async (state) => {
  // return agent's final response,
  // excluding inner monologue
  const response = await hotelAssistant.invoke(state);
  return { messages: [response.messages.at(-1)] };
};
```

</Warning>

### Control agent inputs



You can use the [`Send()`](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraphjs/reference/classes/langgraph.Send.html) primitive to directly send data to the worker agents during the handoff. For example, you can request that the calling agent populate a task description for the next agent:

```python {highlight={32}}
import { tool } from "@langchain/core/tools";
import { Command, Send, MessagesZodState } from "@langchain/langgraph";
import { z } from "zod";

function createTaskDescriptionHandoffTool({
  agentName,
  description,
}: {
  agentName: string;
  description?: string;
}) {
  const name = `transfer_to_${agentName}`;
  const toolDescription = description || `Ask ${agentName} for help.`;

  return tool(
    async (
      { taskDescription },
      config
    ) => {
      const state = config.state;
      
      const taskDescriptionMessage = {
        role: "user" as const,
        content: taskDescription,
      };
      const agentInput = {
        ...state,
        messages: [taskDescriptionMessage],
      };
      
      return new Command({
        goto: [new Send(agentName, agentInput)],
        graph: Command.PARENT,
      });
    },
    {
      name,
      description: toolDescription,
      schema: z.object({
        taskDescription: z
          .string()
          .describe(
            "Description of what the next agent should do, including all of the relevant context."
          ),
      }),
    }
  );
}
```


See the multi-agent [supervisor](/oss/javascript/agent-supervisor#4-create-delegation-tasks) example for a full example of using [`Send()`](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraphjs/reference/classes/langgraph.Send.html) in handoffs.

## Build a multi-agent system

You can use handoffs in any agents built with LangGraph. We recommend using the prebuilt [agent](/oss/javascript/agentic-architectures) or [`ToolNode`](/oss/javascript/call-tools#toolnode), as they natively support handoffs tools returning `Command`. Below is an example of how you can implement a multi-agent system for booking travel using handoffs:



```typescript {highlight={28,29,34,35,40,41}}
import { createReactAgent } from "@langchain/langgraph/prebuilt";
import { StateGraph, START, MessagesZodState } from "@langchain/langgraph";
import { z } from "zod";

function createHandoffTool({
  agentName,
  description,
}: {
  agentName: string;
  description?: string;
}) {
  // same implementation as above
  // ...
  return new Command(/* ... */);
}

// Handoffs
const transferToHotelAssistant = createHandoffTool({
  agentName: "hotel_assistant",
});
const transferToFlightAssistant = createHandoffTool({
  agentName: "flight_assistant",
});

// Define agents
const flightAssistant = createReactAgent({
  llm: model,
  tools: [/* ... */, transferToHotelAssistant],
  name: "flight_assistant",
});

const hotelAssistant = createReactAgent({
  llm: model,
  tools: [/* ... */, transferToFlightAssistant],
  name: "hotel_assistant",
});

// Define multi-agent graph
const multiAgentGraph = new StateGraph(MessagesZodState)
  .addNode("flight_assistant", flightAssistant)
  .addNode("hotel_assistant", hotelAssistant)
  .addEdge(START, "flight_assistant")
  .compile();
```

## Multi-turn conversation

Users might want to engage in a *multi-turn conversation* with one or more agents. To build a system that can handle this, you can create a node that uses an [`interrupt`](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraphjs/reference/functions/langgraph.interrupt-2.html) to collect user input and routes back to the **active** agent.

The agents can then be implemented as nodes in a graph that executes agent steps and determines the next action:

1. **Wait for user input** to continue the conversation, or  
2. **Route to another agent** (or back to itself, such as in a loop) via a [handoff](#handoffs)



```typescript
import { interrupt, Command } from "@langchain/langgraph";

function human(state: MessagesState): Command {
  const userInput: string = interrupt("Ready for user input.");

  // Determine the active agent
  const activeAgent = /* ... */;

  return new Command({
    update: {
      messages: [{
        role: "human",
        content: userInput,
      }]
    },
    goto: activeAgent,
  });
}

function agent(state: MessagesState): Command {
  // The condition for routing/halting can be anything, e.g. LLM tool call / structured output, etc.
  const goto = getNextAgent(/* ... */); // 'agent' / 'anotherAgent'

  if (goto) {
    return new Command({
      goto,
      update: { myStateKey: "myStateValue" }
    });
  }

  return new Command({ goto: "human" });
}
```


<Accordion title="Full example: multi-agent system for travel recommendations">
  In this example, we will build a team of travel assistant agents that can communicate with each other via handoffs.

## Prebuilt implementations

LangGraph comes with prebuilt implementations of two of the most popular multi-agent architectures:



* [supervisor](/oss/javascript/multi-agent-prebuilts#supervisor) — individual agents are coordinated by a central supervisor agent. The supervisor controls all communication flow and task delegation, making decisions about which agent to invoke based on the current context and task requirements. You can use [`langgraph-supervisor`](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph-supervisor-js) library to create a supervisor multi-agent systems.
* [swarm](/oss/javascript/multi-agent-prebuilts#swarm) — agents dynamically hand off control to one another based on their specializations. The system remembers which agent was last active, ensuring that on subsequent interactions, the conversation resumes with that agent. You can use [`langgraph-swarm`](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph-swarm-js) library to create a swarm multi-agent systems.
