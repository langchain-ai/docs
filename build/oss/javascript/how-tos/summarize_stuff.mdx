# How to summarize text in a single LLM call

LLMs can summarize and otherwise distill desired information from text, including large volumes of text. In many cases, especially for models with larger context windows, this can be adequately achieved via a single LLM call.

LangChain implements a simple [pre-built chain](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/langchain/chains/langchain.chains.combine_documents.stuff.create_stuff_documents_chain.html) that "stuffs" a prompt with the desired context for summarization and other purposes. In this guide we demonstrate how to use the chain.

## Load chat model

Let's first load a [chat model](/oss/javascript/concepts/chat_models/):

<ChatModelTabs
  customVarName="llm"
/>



```python
# | output: false
# | echo: false

from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o-mini", temperature=0)
```

## Load documents

Next, we need some documents to summarize. Below, we generate some toy documents for illustrative purposes. See the document loader [how-to guides](/oss/javascript/how-to/#document-loaders) and [integration pages](/oss/javascript/integrations/document_loaders/) for additional sources of data. The [summarization tutorial](/oss/javascript/tutorials/summarization) also includes an example summarizing a blog post.


```python
from langchain_core.documents import Document

documents = [
    Document(page_content="Apples are red", metadata={"title": "apple_book"}),
    Document(page_content="Blueberries are blue", metadata={"title": "blueberry_book"}),
    Document(page_content="Bananas are yelow", metadata={"title": "banana_book"}),
]
```

## Load chain

Below, we define a simple prompt and instantiate the chain with our chat model and documents:


```python
from langchain.chains.combine_documents import create_stuff_documents_chain
from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate

prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template("Summarize this content: {context}")
chain = create_stuff_documents_chain(llm, prompt)
```

## Invoke chain

Because the chain is a [Runnable](/oss/javascript/concepts/runnables), it implements the usual methods for invocation:


```python
result = chain.invoke({"context": documents})
result
```



```output
'The content describes the colors of three fruits: apples are red, blueberries are blue, and bananas are yellow.'
```


### Streaming

Note that the chain also supports streaming of individual output tokens:


```python
for chunk in chain.stream({"context": documents}):
    print(chunk, end="|")
```
```output
|The| content| describes| the| colors| of| three| fruits|:| apples| are| red|,| blueberries| are| blue|,| and| bananas| are| yellow|.||
```
