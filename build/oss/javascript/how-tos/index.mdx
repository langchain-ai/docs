## LangChain Expression Language (LCEL)

<Note>
**Should I use LCEL?**


LCEL is an orchestration solution. See our
[concepts page](/oss/javascript/concepts/lcel/#should-i-use-lcel) for recommendations on when to
use LCEL.

</Note>

[LangChain Expression Language](/oss/javascript/concepts/lcel) is a way to create arbitrary custom chains. It is built on the [Runnable](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/core/runnables/langchain_core.runnables.base.Runnable.html) protocol.

## [LangGraph](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph)

LangGraph is an extension of LangChain aimed at
building robust and stateful multi-actor applications with LLMs by modeling steps as edges and nodes in a graph.

LangGraph documentation is currently hosted on a separate site.
You can find the [LangGraph guides here](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/guides/).

## [LangSmith](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/)

LangSmith allows you to closely trace, monitor and evaluate your LLM application.
It seamlessly integrates with LangChain and LangGraph, and you can use it to inspect and debug individual steps of your chains and agents as you build.

LangSmith documentation is hosted on a separate site.
You can peruse [LangSmith how-to guides here](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/), but we'll highlight a few sections that are particularly
relevant to LangChain below:

### Evaluation
<span data-heading-keywords="evaluation,evaluate"></span>

Evaluating performance is a vital part of building LLM-powered applications.
LangSmith helps with every step of the process from creating a dataset to defining metrics to running evaluators.

To learn more, check out the [LangSmith evaluation how-to guides](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/evaluation/how_to_guides).

### Tracing
<span data-heading-keywords="trace,tracing"></span>

Tracing gives you observability inside your chains and agents, and is vital in diagnosing issues.

- [How to: trace with LangChain](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/observability/how_to_guides/trace_with_langchain)
- [How to: add metadata and tags to traces](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/observability/how_to_guides/add_metadata_tags)

You can see general tracing-related how-tos [in this section of the LangSmith docs](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/observability/how_to_guides#tracing-configuration).
