**Context engineering** is the practice of building dynamic systems that provide the right information and tools, in the right format, so that an AI application can accomplish a task. Context can be characterized along two key dimensions:

1. By **mutability**:
  * **Static context**: Immutable data that doesn't change during execution (e.g., user metadata, database connections, tools)
  * **Dynamic context**: Mutable data that evolves as the application runs (e.g., conversation history, intermediate results, tool call observations)
2. By **lifetime**:
  * **Runtime context**: Data scoped to a single run or invocation
  * **Cross-conversation context**: Data that persists across multiple conversations or sessions

<Tip>
  **Runtime context vs LLM context**
  Runtime context refers to local context: data and dependencies your code needs to run. It does **not** refer to:
  
  * The LLM context, which is the data passed into the LLM's prompt.
  * The "context window", which is the maximum number of tokens that can be passed to the LLM.
  
  Runtime context can be used to optimize the LLM context. For example, you can use user metadata
  in the runtime context to fetch user preferences and feed them into the context window.
</Tip>

LangGraph provides three ways to manage context, which combines the mutability and lifetime dimensions:

## Config

Config is for immutable data like user metadata or API keys. Use this when you have values that don't change mid-run.

Specify configuration using a key called **"configurable"** which is reserved for this purpose.

```javascript {highlight={4}}
await graph.invoke(
  // (1)!
  { messages: [{ role: "user", content: "hi!" }] }, // (2)!
  { configurable: { user_id: "user_123" } } // (3)!
);
```


<a id="state"></a>
## Dynamic runtime context

**Dynamic runtime context** represents mutable data that can evolve during a single run and is managed through the LangGraph state object. This includes conversation history, intermediate results, and values derived from tools or LLM outputs. In LangGraph, the state object acts as [short-term memory](/oss/javascript/memory) during a run.

  <Tab title="In an agent">
    Example shows how to incorporate state into an agent **prompt**.
    
    State can also be accessed by the agent's **tools**, which can read or update the state as needed. See [tool calling guide](/oss/javascript/call-tools#short-term-memory) for details.
    

    
    ```python {highlight={6,12,22}}
    import type { BaseMessage } from "@langchain/core/messages";
    import { createReactAgent } from "@langchain/langgraph/prebuilt";
    import { MessagesZodState } from "@langchain/langgraph";
    import { z } from "zod";
    
    const CustomState = z.object({ // (1)!
      messages: MessagesZodState.shape.messages,
      userName: z.string(),
    });
    
    const prompt = (
      state: z.infer<typeof CustomState>
    ): BaseMessage[] => {
      const userName = state.userName;
      const systemMsg = `You are a helpful assistant. User's name is ${userName}`;
      return [{ role: "system", content: systemMsg }, ...state.messages];
    };
    
    const agent = createReactAgent({
      llm: model,
      tools: [...],
      stateSchema: CustomState, // (2)!
      stateModifier: prompt,
    });
    
    await agent.invoke({
      messages: [{ role: "user", content: "hi!" }],
      userName: "John Smith",
    });
```
    
    1. Define a custom state schema that extends `MessagesZodState` or creates a new schema.
    2. Pass the custom state schema to the agent. This allows the agent to access and modify the state during execution.

    ```python {highlight={5,15}}
    import type { BaseMessage } from "@langchain/core/messages";
    import { StateGraph, MessagesZodState, START } from "@langchain/langgraph";
    import { z } from "zod";
    
    const CustomState = z.object({ // (1)!
      messages: MessagesZodState.shape.messages,
      extraField: z.number(),
    });
    
    const builder = new StateGraph(CustomState)
      .addNode("node", async (state) => { // (2)!
        const messages = state.messages;
        // ...
        return { // (3)!
          extraField: state.extraField + 1,
        };
      })
      .addEdge(START, "node");
    
    const graph = builder.compile();
```
    
    1. Define a custom state
    2. Access the state in any node or tool
    3. The Graph API is designed to work as easily as possible with state. The return value of a node represents a requested update to the state.

  **Turning on memory**
  Please see the [memory guide](/oss/javascript/add-memory) for more details on how to enable memory. This is a powerful feature that allows you to persist the agent's state across multiple invocations. Otherwise, the state is scoped only to a single run.

## Dynamic cross-conversation context

**Dynamic cross-conversation context** represents persistent, mutable data that spans across multiple conversations or sessions and is managed through the LangGraph store. This includes user profiles, preferences, and historical interactions. The LangGraph store acts as [long-term memory](/oss/javascript/memory#long-term-memory) across multiple runs. This can be used to read or update persistent facts (e.g., user profiles, preferences, prior interactions).

For more information, see the [Memory guide](/oss/javascript/add-memory).
