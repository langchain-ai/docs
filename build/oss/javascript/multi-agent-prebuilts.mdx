A single agent might struggle if it needs to specialize in multiple domains or manage many tools. To tackle this, you can break your agent into smaller, independent agents and compose them into a [multi-agent system](/oss/javascript/multi-agent).

In multi-agent systems, agents need to communicate between each other. They do so via [handoffs](#handoffs) — a primitive that describes which agent to hand control to and the payload to send to that agent.

Two of the most popular multi-agent architectures are:

* [supervisor](#supervisor) — individual agents are coordinated by a central supervisor agent. The supervisor controls all communication flow and task delegation, making decisions about which agent to invoke based on the current context and task requirements.
* [swarm](#swarm) — agents dynamically hand off control to one another based on their specializations. The system remembers which agent was last active, ensuring that on subsequent interactions, the conversation resumes with that agent.

## Supervisor

Use [`@langchain/langgraph-supervisor`](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraphjs/tree/main/libs/langgraph-supervisor) library to create a supervisor multi-agent system:

```bash
npm install @langchain/langgraph-supervisor
```

```typescript {highlight={3,19,26,29}}
import { ChatOpenAI } from "@langchain/openai";
import { createReactAgent } from "@langchain/langgraph/prebuilt";
import { createSupervisor } from "langgraph-supervisor";

function bookHotel(hotelName: string) {
  /**Book a hotel*/
  return `Successfully booked a stay at ${hotelName}.`;
}

function bookFlight(fromAirport: string, toAirport: string) {
  /**Book a flight*/
  return `Successfully booked a flight from ${fromAirport} to ${toAirport}.`;
}

const flightAssistant = createReactAgent({
  llm: "openai:gpt-4o",
  tools: [bookFlight],
  stateModifier: "You are a flight booking assistant",
  name: "flight_assistant",
});

const hotelAssistant = createReactAgent({
  llm: "openai:gpt-4o",
  tools: [bookHotel],
  stateModifier: "You are a hotel booking assistant",
  name: "hotel_assistant",
});

const supervisor = createSupervisor({
  agents: [flightAssistant, hotelAssistant],
  llm: new ChatOpenAI({ model: "gpt-4o" }),
  systemPrompt:
    "You manage a hotel booking assistant and a " +
    "flight booking assistant. Assign work to them.",
});

for await (const chunk of supervisor.stream({
  messages: [
    {
      role: "user",
      content: "book a flight from BOS to JFK and a stay at McKittrick Hotel",
    },
  ],
})) {
  console.log(chunk);
  console.log("\n");
}
```


## Swarm

![Swarm](/oss/images/swarm.png)



Use [`@langchain/langgraph-swarm`](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraphjs/tree/main/libs/langgraph-swarm) library to create a swarm multi-agent system:

```bash
npm install @langchain/langgraph-swarm
```

```typescript {highlight={2,16,18,23,25,28}}
import { createReactAgent } from "@langchain/langgraph/prebuilt";
import { createSwarm, createHandoffTool } from "@langchain/langgraph-swarm";

const transferToHotelAssistant = createHandoffTool({
  agentName: "hotel_assistant",
  description: "Transfer user to the hotel-booking assistant.",
});

const transferToFlightAssistant = createHandoffTool({
  agentName: "flight_assistant",
  description: "Transfer user to the flight-booking assistant.",
});

const flightAssistant = createReactAgent({
  llm: "anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-latest",
  tools: [bookFlight, transferToHotelAssistant],
  stateModifier: "You are a flight booking assistant",
  name: "flight_assistant",
});

const hotelAssistant = createReactAgent({
  llm: "anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-latest",
  tools: [bookHotel, transferToFlightAssistant],
  stateModifier: "You are a hotel booking assistant",
  name: "hotel_assistant",
});

const swarm = createSwarm({
  agents: [flightAssistant, hotelAssistant],
  defaultActiveAgent: "flight_assistant",
});

for await (const chunk of swarm.stream({
  messages: [
    {
      role: "user",
      content: "book a flight from BOS to JFK and a stay at McKittrick Hotel",
    },
  ],
})) {
  console.log(chunk);
  console.log("\n");
}
```


## Handoffs

A common pattern in multi-agent interactions is **handoffs**, where one agent _hands off_ control to another. Handoffs allow you to specify:

* **destination**: target agent to navigate to
* **payload**: information to pass to that agent



This is used both by `@langchain/langgraph-supervisor` (supervisor hands off to individual agents) and `@langchain/langgraph-swarm` (an individual agent can hand off to other agents).

To implement handoffs with `createReactAgent`, you need to:

1. Create a special tool that can transfer control to a different agent
  ```python {highlight={5,7,10}}
  function transferToBob() {
    /**Transfer to bob.*/
    return new Command({
      // name of the agent (node) to go to
      goto: "bob",
      // data to send to the agent
      update: { messages: [...] },
      // indicate to LangGraph that we need to navigate to
      // agent node in a parent graph
      graph: Command.PARENT,
    });
  }
```
2. Create individual agents that have access to handoff tools:
  ```typescript
  const flightAssistant = createReactAgent({
    ..., tools: [bookFlight, transferToHotelAssistant]
  });
  const hotelAssistant = createReactAgent({
    ..., tools: [bookHotel, transferToFlightAssistant]
  });
  ```
3. Define a parent graph that contains individual agents as nodes:
  ```typescript
  import { StateGraph, MessagesZodState } from "@langchain/langgraph";
  const multiAgentGraph = new StateGraph(MessagesZodState)
    .addNode("flight_assistant", flightAssistant)
    .addNode("hotel_assistant", hotelAssistant)
    // ...
  ```


Putting this together, here is how you can implement a simple multi-agent system with two agents — a flight booking assistant and a hotel booking assistant:



```typescript {highlight={32,33,34,89,91,96,98}}
import { tool } from "@langchain/core/tools";
import { ChatAnthropic } from "@langchain/anthropic";
import { createReactAgent } from "@langchain/langgraph/prebuilt";
import {
  StateGraph,
  START,
  MessagesZodState,
  Command,
} from "@langchain/langgraph";
import { z } from "zod";

function createHandoffTool({
  agentName,
  description,
}: {
  agentName: string;
  description?: string;
}) {
  const name = `transfer_to_${agentName}`;
  const toolDescription = description || `Transfer to ${agentName}`;

  return tool(
    async (_, config) => {
      const toolMessage = {
        role: "tool" as const,
        content: `Successfully transferred to ${agentName}`,
        name: name,
        tool_call_id: config.toolCall?.id!,
      };
      return new Command({
        // (2)!
        goto: agentName, // (3)!
        update: { messages: [toolMessage] }, // (4)!
        graph: Command.PARENT, // (5)!
      });
    },
    {
      name,
      description: toolDescription,
      schema: z.object({}),
    }
  );
}

// Handoffs
const transferToHotelAssistant = createHandoffTool({
  agentName: "hotel_assistant",
  description: "Transfer user to the hotel-booking assistant.",
});

const transferToFlightAssistant = createHandoffTool({
  agentName: "flight_assistant",
  description: "Transfer user to the flight-booking assistant.",
});

// Simple agent tools
const bookHotel = tool(
  async ({ hotelName }) => {
    /**Book a hotel*/
    return `Successfully booked a stay at ${hotelName}.`;
  },
  {
    name: "book_hotel",
    description: "Book a hotel",
    schema: z.object({
      hotelName: z.string().describe("Name of the hotel to book"),
    }),
  }
);

const bookFlight = tool(
  async ({ fromAirport, toAirport }) => {
    /**Book a flight*/
    return `Successfully booked a flight from ${fromAirport} to ${toAirport}.`;
  },
  {
    name: "book_flight",
    description: "Book a flight",
    schema: z.object({
      fromAirport: z.string().describe("Departure airport code"),
      toAirport: z.string().describe("Arrival airport code"),
    }),
  }
);

// Define agents
const flightAssistant = createReactAgent({
  llm: new ChatAnthropic({ model: "anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-latest" }),
  tools: [bookFlight, transferToHotelAssistant],
  stateModifier: "You are a flight booking assistant",
  name: "flight_assistant",
});

const hotelAssistant = createReactAgent({
  llm: new ChatAnthropic({ model: "anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-latest" }),
  tools: [bookHotel, transferToFlightAssistant],
  stateModifier: "You are a hotel booking assistant",
  name: "hotel_assistant",
});

// Define multi-agent graph
const multiAgentGraph = new StateGraph(MessagesZodState)
  .addNode("flight_assistant", flightAssistant)
  .addNode("hotel_assistant", hotelAssistant)
  .addEdge(START, "flight_assistant")
  .compile();

// Run the multi-agent graph
for await (const chunk of multiAgentGraph.stream({
  messages: [
    {
      role: "user",
      content: "book a flight from BOS to JFK and a stay at McKittrick Hotel",
    },
  ],
})) {
  console.log(chunk);
  console.log("\n");
}
```

1. Access agent's state
2. The `Command` primitive allows specifying a state update and a node transition as a single operation, making it useful for implementing handoffs.
3. Name of the agent or node to hand off to.
4. Take the agent's messages and **add** them to the parent's **state** as part of the handoff. The next agent will see the parent state.
5. Indicate to LangGraph that we need to navigate to agent node in a **parent** multi-agent graph.


<Note>
  This handoff implementation assumes that:
  
  * each agent receives overall message history (across all agents) in the multi-agent system as its input
  * each agent outputs its internal messages history to the overall message history of the multi-agent system
</Note>
