# How to construct filters

<Info>
**Prerequisites**


This guide assumes familiarity with the following:

- [Query analysis](/oss/javascript/tutorials/rag#query-analysis)

</Info>

We may want to do query analysis to extract filters to pass into retrievers. One way we ask the LLM to represent these filters is as a Zod schema. There is then the issue of converting that Zod schema into a filter that can be passed into a retriever. 

This can be done manually, but LangChain also provides some "Translators" that are able to translate from a common syntax into filters specific to each retriever. Here, we will cover how to use those translators.

## Setup

### Install dependencies

```{=mdx}
<Npm2Yarn>
  @langchain/core zod
</Npm2Yarn>
```
In this example, `year` and `author` are both attributes to filter on.


```typescript
import { z } from "zod";

const searchSchema = z.object({
  query: z.string(),
  startYear: z.number().optional(),
  author: z.string().optional(),
})

const searchQuery: z.infer<typeof searchSchema> = {
  query: "RAG",
  startYear: 2022,
  author: "LangChain"
}
```
```typescript
import { Comparison, Comparator } from "langchain/chains/query_constructor/ir";

function constructComparisons(query: z.infer<typeof searchSchema>): Comparison[] {
  const comparisons: Comparison[] = [];
  if (query.startYear !== undefined) {
    comparisons.push(
      new Comparison(
        "gt" as Comparator,
        "start_year",
        query.startYear,
      )
    );
  }
  if (query.author !== undefined) {
    comparisons.push(
      new Comparison(
        "eq" as Comparator,
        "author",
        query.author,
      )
    );
  }
  return comparisons;
}

const comparisons = constructComparisons(searchQuery);
```


```typescript
import {
  Operation,
  Operator,
} from "langchain/chains/query_constructor/ir";

const _filter = new Operation("and" as Operator, comparisons)
```


```typescript
import { ChromaTranslator } from "@langchain/community/structured_query/chroma";

new ChromaTranslator().visitOperation(_filter)
```



```output
{
  "$and": [
    { start_year: { "$gt": 2022 } },
    { author: { "$eq": "LangChain" } }
  ]
}
```
