Trusted by companies shaping the future of agents – including Klarna, Replit, Elastic, and more – LangGraph is a low-level orchestration framework for building, managing, and deploying long-running, stateful agents.

Install LangGraph:

```python
pip install -U langgraph
```




Then, create an agent [using prebuilt components](/oss/python/prebuilts):

```python
# pip install -qU "langchain[anthropic]" to call the model

from langgraph.prebuilt import create_react_agent

def get_weather(city: str) -> str:
    """Get weather for a given city."""
    return f"It's always sunny in {city}!"

agent = create_react_agent(
    model="anthropic:claude-3-7-sonnet-latest",
    tools=[get_weather],
    prompt="You are a helpful assistant"
)

# Run the agent
agent.invoke(
    {"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "what is the weather in sf"}]}
)
```





For more information, see the [Quickstart](/oss/python/quickstart). Or, to learn how to build an [agent workflow](/oss/python/graph-api) with a customizable architecture, long-term memory, and other complex task handling, see the [LangGraph basics tutorials](/oss/python/1-build-basic-chatbot).

## Core benefits

LangGraph provides low-level supporting infrastructure for *any* long-running, stateful workflow or agent. LangGraph does not abstract prompts or architecture, and provides the following central benefits:

* [Durable execution](/oss/python/durable-execution): Build agents that persist through failures and can run for extended periods, automatically resuming from exactly where they left off.
* [Human-in-the-loop](/oss/python/human-in-the-loop): Seamlessly incorporate human oversight by inspecting and modifying agent state at any point during execution.
* [Comprehensive memory](/oss/python/memory): Create truly stateful agents with both short-term working memory for ongoing reasoning and long-term persistent memory across sessions.
* [Debugging with LangSmith](http://www.langchain.com/langsmith): Gain deep visibility into complex agent behavior with visualization tools that trace execution paths, capture state transitions, and provide detailed runtime metrics.
* [Production-ready deployment](/langgraph-platform/deployment-options): Deploy sophisticated agent systems confidently with scalable infrastructure designed to handle the unique challenges of stateful, long-running workflows.

## LangGraph’s ecosystem

While LangGraph can be used standalone, it also integrates seamlessly with any LangChain product, giving developers a full suite of tools for building agents. To improve your LLM application development, pair LangGraph with:

* [LangSmith](http://www.langchain.com/langsmith) — Helpful for agent evals and observability. Debug poor-performing LLM app runs, evaluate agent trajectories, gain visibility in production, and improve performance over time.
* [LangGraph Platform](/langgraph-platform) — Deploy and scale agents effortlessly with a purpose-built deployment platform for long running, stateful workflows. Discover, reuse, configure, and share agents across teams — and iterate quickly with visual prototyping in [LangGraph Studio](/langgraph-platform/langgraph-studio).
* [LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/docs/introduction/) – Provides integrations and composable components to streamline LLM application development.
