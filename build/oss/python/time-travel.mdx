When working with non-deterministic systems that make model-based decisions (e.g., agents powered by LLMs), it can be useful to examine their decision-making process in detail:

1. 🤔 **Understand reasoning**: Analyze the steps that led to a successful result.
2. 🐞 **Debug mistakes**: Identify where and why errors occurred.
3. 🔍 **Explore alternatives**: Test different paths to uncover better solutions.

LangGraph provides [time travel functionality](/oss/python/time-travel) to support these use cases. Specifically, you can resume execution from a prior checkpoint — either replaying the same state or modifying it to explore alternatives. In all cases, resuming past execution produces a new fork in the history.
