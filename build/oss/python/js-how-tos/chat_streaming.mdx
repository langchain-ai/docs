# How to stream chat model responses

All [chat models](https://api.js.langchain.com/classes/langchain_core.language_models_chat_models.BaseChatModel.html) implement the [Runnable interface](https://.api.js.langchain.com/classes/langchain_core.runnables.Runnable.html), which comes with **default** implementations of standard runnable methods (i.e. `invoke`, `batch`, `stream`, `streamEvents`). This guide covers how to use these methods to stream output from chat models.

:::{.callout-tip}

The **default** implementation does **not** provide support for token-by-token streaming, and will instead return an [`AsyncGenerator`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/AsyncGenerator) that will yield all model output in a single chunk. It exists to ensures that the the model can be swapped in for any other model as it supports the same standard interface.

The ability to stream the output token-by-token depends on whether the provider has implemented token-by-token streaming support.

You can see which [integrations support token-by-token streaming here](/oss/python/integrations/chat/).

## Streaming

Below, we use a `---` to help visualize the delimiter between tokens.

```{=mdx}
<ChatModelTabs />
```
```typescript
// @lc-docs-hide-cell
import { ChatAnthropic } from "@langchain/anthropic";

const model = new ChatAnthropic({
  model: "claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620",
});
```


```typescript
const stream = await model.stream("Write me a 1 verse song about goldfish on the moon")

for await (const chunk of stream) {
  console.log(`${chunk.content}\n---`);
}
```
```output
---
Here's
---
 a one
---
-
---
verse song about goldfish on
---
 the moon:

---

---

---

---

Goldfish on the moon,
---

---

---
```
## Stream events

Chat models also support the standard [`streamEvents()`](https://api.js.langchain.com/classes/langchain_core.runnables.Runnable.html#streamEvents) method to stream more granular events from within chains.

This method is useful if you're streaming output from a larger LLM application that contains multiple steps (e.g., a chain composed of a prompt, chat model and parser):


```typescript
const eventStream = await model.streamEvents(
  "Write me a 1 verse song about goldfish on the moon",
  {
    version: "v2"
  },
);

const events = [];
for await (const event of eventStream) {
  events.push(event);
}

events.slice(0, 3);
```



```output
[
  {
    event: "on_chat_model_start",
    data: { input: "Write me a 1 verse song about goldfish on the moon" },
    name: "ChatAnthropic",
