These guides are _goal-oriented_ and _concrete_; they're meant to help you complete a specific task.
For conceptual explanations see [Conceptual Guides](/oss/python/concepts/).
For end-to-end walkthroughs see [Tutorials](/docs/tutorials).

LangSmith documentation is hosted on a separate site.
You can peruse [LangSmith how-to guides here](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/observability/how_to_guides), but we'll highlight a few sections that are particularly
relevant to LangChain below:

### Evaluation

<span data-heading-keywords="evaluation,evaluate"></span>

Evaluating performance is a vital part of building LLM-powered applications.
LangSmith helps with every step of the process from creating a dataset to defining metrics to running evaluators.

To learn more, check out the [LangSmith evaluation how-to guides](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/evaluation/how_to_guides).

### Tracing
