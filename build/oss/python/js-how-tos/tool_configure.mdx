Tools are runnables, and you can treat them the same way as any other runnable at the interface level - you can call `invoke()`, `batch()`, and `stream()` on them as normal. However, when writing custom tools, you may want to invoke other runnables like chat models or retrievers. In order to properly trace and configure those sub-invocations, you'll need to manually access and pass in the tool's current [`RunnableConfig`](https://api.js.langchain.com/interfaces/langchain_core.runnables.RunnableConfig.html) object.

This guide covers how to do this for custom tools created in different ways.

## From the `tool` method

Accessing the `RunnableConfig` object for a custom tool created with the [`tool`](https://api.js.langchain.com/functions/langchain_core.tools.tool-1.html) helper method is simple - it's always the second parameter passed into your custom function. Here's an example:


```typescript
import { z } from "zod";
import { tool } from "@langchain/core/tools";
import type { RunnableConfig } from "@langchain/core/runnables";

const reverseTool = tool(
  async (input: { text: string }, config?: RunnableConfig) => {
    const originalString = input.text + (config?.configurable?.additional_field ?? "");
    return originalString.split("").reverse().join("");
  }, {
    name: "reverse",
    description: "A test tool that combines input text with a configurable parameter.",
    schema: z.object({
      text: z.string()
    }),
  }
);
```
Then, if we invoke the tool with a `config` containing a `configurable` field, we can see that `additional_field` is passed through correctly:


```typescript
await reverseTool.invoke(
  {text: "abc"}, {configurable: {additional_field: "123"}}
)
```
```output
321cba
```
