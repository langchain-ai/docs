Welcome to the LangSmith Observability documentation. The following sections help you set up and use tracing, monitoring, and observability features:

- **Set up tracing**: Configure tracing for your applications with basic configuration, integrations with popular frameworks, and advanced configuration options.

- **View traces**: Access and manage your traces through the UI and API, including filtering, exporting, sharing, and comparing traces.

- **Monitoring**: Set up dashboards and alerts to monitor your application performance and receive notifications when issues arise.

- **Automations**: Configure rules, webhooks, and online evaluations to automate your observability workflows.

- **Human Feedback**: Collect and manage human feedback on your application outputs through annotation queues and inline annotation.

- **Trace a RAG application**: Follow a tutorial to trace a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application from start to finish.
