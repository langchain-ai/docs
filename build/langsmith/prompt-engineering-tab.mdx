Welcome to the LangSmith Prompt Engineering documentation. The following sections help you create, manage, and optimize your prompts:

- **Create and update prompts**: Create prompts through the UI or SDK, configure settings, use tools, include multimodal content, and connect to different model providers.

- **Manage prompts**: Organize your prompts with tags, commit changes, trigger webhooks, and share prompts through the public prompt hub.

- **Prompt hub**: Access and manage prompt tags and explore the LangChain Hub for community prompts.

- **Prompt playground**: Test and experiment with prompts using custom endpoints and model configurations.

- **Tutorials**: Follow tutorials to optimize classifiers and learn advanced prompt engineering techniques.
