Welcome to the LangSmith Observability documentation. The following sections help you set up and use tracing, monitoring, and observability features:

- **Set up tracing**: Configure tracing for your applications with basic configuration, [integrations](/langsmith/trace-with-langgraph) with popular frameworks, and advanced configuration options.

- **View traces**: Access and manage your traces through the UI and API, including [filtering](/langsmith/filter-traces-in-application), [exporting](/langsmith/data-export), [sharing](/langsmith/share-trace), and [comparing](/langsmith/compare-traces) traces.

- **Monitoring**: Set up [dashboards](/langsmith/dashboards) and [alerts](/langsmith/alerts) to monitor your application performance and receive notifications when issues arise.

- **Automations**: Configure [rules](/langsmith/rules), [webhooks](/langsmith/webhooks), and [online evaluations](/langsmith/online-evaluations) to automate your observability workflows.

- **Human Feedback**: [Collect and manage human feedback](/langsmith/attach-user-feedback) on your application outputs through annotation queues and inline annotation.

- **Trace a RAG application**: Follow a [tutorial to trace a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application](/langsmith/observability-llm-tutorial) from start to finish.

For terminology definitions and core concepts, refer to the [introduction on observability](/langsmith/observability-concepts).
