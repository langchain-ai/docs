**Feedback** is LangSmith's way of storing the criteria and scores from evaluation on a particular trace or intermediate run (span). Feedback can be produced from a variety of ways, such as:

1. [Sent up along with a trace](/langsmith/attach-user-feedback) from the LLM application
2. Generated by a user in the app [inline](/langsmith/annotate-traces-inline) or in an [annotation queue](/langsmith/annotation-queues)
3. Generated by an automatic evaluator during [offline evaluation](/langsmith/evaluate-llm-application)
4. Generated by an [online evaluator](/langsmith/online-evaluations)

Feedback is stored in a simple format with the following fields:

| Field Name                | Type     | Description                                                                                            |
| ------------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| id                        | UUID     | Unique identifier for the record itself                                                                |
| created\_at               | datetime | Timestamp when the record was created                                                                  |
| modified\_at              | datetime | Timestamp when the record was last modified                                                            |
| session\_id               | UUID     | Unique identifier for the experiment or tracing project the run was a part of                          |
| run\_id                   | UUID     | Unique identifier for a specific run within a session                                                  |
| key                       | string   | A key describing the criteria of the feedback, eg "correctness"                                        |
| score                     | number   | Numerical score associated with the feedback key                                                       |
| value                     | string   | Reserved for storing a value associated with the score. Useful for categorical feedback.               |
| comment                   | string   | Any comment or annotation associated with the record. This can be a justification for the score given. |
| correction                | object   | Reserved for storing correction details, if any                                                        |
| feedback\_source          | object   | Object containing information about the feedback source                                                |
| feedback\_source.type     | string   | The type of source where the feedback originated, eg "api", "app", "evaluator"                         |
| feedback\_source.metadata | object   | Reserved for additional metadata, currently                                                            |
| feedback\_source.user\_id | UUID     | Unique identifier for the user providing feedback                                                      |
