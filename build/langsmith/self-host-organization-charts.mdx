LangSmith automatically generates and syncs organization usage charts for self-hosted installations.

These charts are available under `Settings > Usage and billing > Usage graph`:

* Usage by Workspace: this counts traces (root runs) by workspace
* Organization Usage: this counts all traces (root runs) for the organization

The charts are refreshed to include any new workspaces every 5 minutes. Note that the charts are not editable.
