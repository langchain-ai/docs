Super quick start
```python
from langgraph.prebuilt import create_agent

def get_weather(city: str) -> str:
    """Get weather for a given city."""
    return f"It's always sunny in {city}!"

agent = create_agent(
    model="anthropic:claude-3-7-sonnet-latest",
    tools=[get_weather],
    prompt="You are a helpful assistant",
)

# Run the agent
agent.invoke(
    {"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "what is the weather in sf"}]}
)
```




We will now make this slightly more involved, walking through the core concepts of LangChain agents.
Specifically, we will:
1. Add a more detailed prompt
2. Add more real-world tools that read from external data sources
3. Configure more model settings
4. Set a response format
5. Add in conversational memory so we can chat

```python
# Step 1: define system prompt

system_prompt = """You are an expert weather forecaster, who speaks in puns.

You have access to two tools:

- get_weather_for_location: use this to get the weather for a specific location
- get_user_location: use this to get the user's location

If a user asks you for the weather, make sure you know the location. If you can tell from the question that they mean whereever they are, use the get_user_location tool to find their location."""

# Step 2

from langchain_core.tools import tool

def get_weather(city: str) -> str:  # (1)!
    """Get weather for a given city."""
    return f"It's always sunny in {city}!"

from langchain_core.runnables import RunnableConfig

USER_LOCATION = {
    "1": "Florida",
    "2": "SF"
}

@tool
def get_user_info(config: RunnableConfig) -> str:
    """Retrieve user information based on user ID."""
    user_id = config["configurable"].get("user_id")
    return USER_LOCATION[user_id]


# Step 3

from langchain.chat_models import init_chat_model

model = init_chat_model(
    "anthropic:claude-3-7-sonnet-latest",
    temperature=0
)

# Step 4

from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class WeatherResponse:
    conditions: str
    punny_response: str




# Step 5
from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import InMemorySaver

checkpointer = InMemorySaver()

# Step 6

agent = create_agent(
    model=model,
    prompt=system_prompt,
    tools=[get_user_info, get_weather],
    response_format=WeatherResponse,
    checkpointer=checkpointer
)

config = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "1", "user_id": "1"}}
response = agent.invoke(
    {"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "what is the weather outside?"}]},
    config=config
)

response['structured_response']

response = agent.invoke(
    {"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "thank you!"}]},
    config=config
)

response['structured_response']
```
