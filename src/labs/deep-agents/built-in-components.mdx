title: Built-in components
---

Deep Agents comes with a number of built-in components that help agents perform complex tasks.

## System prompt

Deep Agents comes with a detailed system prompt heavily inspired by Claude Code's architecture. This prompt provides instructions for using the planning tool, file system tools, and sub agents effectively.

## Planning tool

A simple planning tool based on Claude Code's TodoWrite functionality that helps agents create and track plans in their context, keeping them on track for complex tasks.

## File system tools

Four built-in tools that mock a file system using LangGraph's state:

- `ls` - List files and directories
- `read_file` - Read file contents  
- `write_file` - Write to files
- `edit_file` - Edit existing files

Files can be passed in and retrieved via the files key:

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
# Pass files to the agent
result = agent.invoke({
    "messages": [...],
    "files": {"foo.txt": "file content", ...}
})

# Access files after execution
updated_files = result["files"]
```

```typescript JavaScript
const result = await agent.invoke({
  messages: [...],
  // Pass in files to the agent using this key
  files: {"foo.txt": "foo", ...}
});

// Access any files afterwards like this
result.files;
```

</CodeGroup>

## Sub-agents

Built-in support for calling specialized sub-agents with the following:

- **Context quarantine**: Prevents polluting the main agent's context
- **Custom instructions**: Tailored prompts for specific tasks  
- **Tool access control**: Subagents can have different tool sets

A general-purpose sub-agent with the same instructions and tools as the main agent is always available.
