Single Sign-On (SSO) functionality is available for Enterprise Cloud customers to access LangSmith through a single authentication source. This allows administrators to centrally manage team access and keeps information more secure.

LangSmith's SSO configuration is built using the SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) 2.0 standard. SAML 2.0 enables connecting an Identity Provider (IdP) to your organization for an easier, more secure login experience.

See [SCIM setup](/langsmith/set-up-scim) for instructions on using SCIM along with SAML for user provisioning and deprovisioning.

<Note>
  SAML SSO is available for organizations on the [Enterprise plan](https://www.langchain.com/pricing-langsmith). Please [contact sales](https://www.langchain.com/contact-sales) to learn more.

## What is SAML SSO?

SSO services permit a user to use one set of credentials (for example, a name or email address and password) to access multiple applications. The service authenticates the end user only once for all the applications the user has been given rights to and eliminates further prompts when the user switches applications during the same session.

## Benefits of SSO

* Streamlines user management across systems for organization owners.
* Enables organizations to enforce their own security policies (e.g. MFA)
* Removes the need for end-users to remember and manage multiple passwords. Simplifies end-users experience by allowing them to sign in at one single access point and enjoy a seamless experience across multiple applications.

## Set up SAML SSO for your organization

### Prerequisites

* Your organization must be on an Enterprise plan
* Your Identity Provider (IdP) must support the SAML 2.0 standard
* Only [Organization Admins](/langsmith/observability-overview#organization-roles) can configure SAML SSO

### Initial configuration

<Note>
  See IdP-specific instructions [below](#identity-provider-idp-setup)
</Note>

<Note>
  The URLs are different for the US and EU. Please make sure to select your region from the dropdown in the top right.
</Note>

1. In your IdP: Configure a SAML application with the following details, then copy the metadata URL or XML for step 3 below

   1. Single sign-on URL a.k.a. ACS URL: [https://auth.langchain.com/auth/v1/sso/saml/acs](https://auth.langchain.com/auth/v1/sso/saml/acs)
   2. Audience URI a.k.a. SP Entity ID: [https://auth.langchain.com/auth/v1/sso/saml/metadata](https://auth.langchain.com/auth/v1/sso/saml/metadata)
   3. Name ID format: email address
   4. Application username: email address
   5. Required claims: `sub` and `email`

2. In LangSmith: Go to `Settings` -> `Members and roles` -> `SSO Configuration`

   1. Fill in the required information and submit to activate SSO login

      1. Fill in either the `SAML metadata URL` or `SAML metadata XML`
      2. Select the `Default workspace role` and `Default workspaces`. New users logging in via SSO will be added to the specified workspaces with the selected role.

### Editing SAML SSO settings

* `Default workspace role` and `Default workspaces` are editable. The updated settings will apply to new users only, not existing users.
* (Coming soon) `SAML metadata URL` and `SAML metadata XML` are editable. This is usually only necessary when cryptographic keys are rotated/expired or the metadata URL has changed but the same IdP is still used.

## Just-in-time (JIT) provisioning

LangSmith supports Just-in-Time provisioning when using SAML SSO. This allows someone signing in via SAML SSO to join the organization and selected workspaces automatically as a member.

<Note>
  JIT provisioning only runs for new users i.e. users who do not already have access to the organization with the same email address via a [different login method](/langsmith/authentication-methods#cloud)
</Note>

## Login methods and access

Once you have completed your configuration of SAML SSO for your organization, users will be able to login via SAML SSO in addition to [other login methods](/langsmith/authentication-methods#cloud) such as username/password and Google Authentication.

* When logged in via SAML SSO, users can only access the corresponding organization with SAML SSO configured.
* Users with SAML SSO as their only login method do not have [personal organizations](/langsmith/observability-overview#organizations)
* When logged in via any other method, users can access the organization with SAML SSO configured along with any other organizations they are a part of

## Enforce SAML SSO only

To ensure users can only access the organization when logged in using SAML SSO and no other method, check the `Login via SSO only` checkbox and click `Save`. Once this happens, users accessing the organization that are logged-in via a non-SSO login method are required to log back in using SAML SSO. This setting can be switched back to allow all login methods by unselecting the checkbox and clicking `Save`.

<Note>
  You must be logged in via SAML SSO in order to update this setting to `Only SAML SSO`. This is to ensure the SAML settings are valid and avoid locking users out of your organization.
</Note>

## Support and troubleshooting

If you have issues setting up SAML SSO, please reach out to [support@langchain.dev](mailto:support@langchain.dev).

### FAQ

#### *How do I change a SAML SSO user's email address?*

Some identity providers retain the original `User ID` through an email change while others do not, so we recommend that you follow these steps to avoid duplicate users in LangSmith:

1. Remove the user from the organization (see [here](/langsmith/set-up-organization#manage-users))
2. Change their email address in the IdP
3. Have them login to LangSmith again via SAML SSO - this will trigger the usual [JIT provisioning](#just-in-time-jit-provisioning) flow with their new email address

#### *How do I fix "405 method not allowed"?*

   1. `sub`: `user.objectid`
   2. `emailaddress`: `user.userprincipalname` or `user.mail` (if using the latter, ensure all users have the `Email` field filled in under `Contact Information`)
   3. (Optional) For SCIM, see the [setup documentation](/langsmith/set-up-scim) for specific instructions about `Unique User Identifier (Name ID)`

6. On the SAML-based Sign-on page, under `SAML Certificates`, copy the `App Federation Metadata Url`.

**Step 3: Set up LangSmith SSO Configuration**

Follow the instructions under [initial configuration](#initial-configuration) in the `Fill in required information` step, using the metadata URL from the previous step.

**Step 4: Verify the SSO setup**

1. Assign the application to users/groups in Entra ID

   1. Select `Manage > Users and groups`

   2. Click `Add user/group`

   3. In the Add Assignment window:

      1. Under Users, click `None Selected`.
      2. Search for the user you want to assign to the enterprise application, and then click `Select`.
      3. Verify that the user is selected, and click `Assign`.

   4. Set `Name ID` format to `EMAIL` and leave `Name ID` as the default (`Basic Information > Primary email`).
   5. Click `Continue`.

7. Use `Add mapping` to ensure required claims are present:
   1. `Basic Information > Primary email` -> `email`

**Step 2: Set up LangSmith SSO Configuration**

Follow the instructions under [initial configuration](#initial-configuration) in the `Fill in required information` step, using the `IDP metadata` from the previous step as the metadata XML.

**Step 3: Turn on the SAML app in Google**

1. Select the SAML app under `Menu -> Apps -> Web and mobile apps`

2. Click `User access`.

3. Turn on the service:

   1. To turn the service on for everyone in your organization, click `On for everyone`, and then click `Save`.

   2. To turn the service on for an organizational unit:

      1. At the left, select the organizational unit then `On`.
      2. If the Service status is set to `Inherited` and you want to keep the updated setting, even if the parent setting changes, click `Override`.
      3. If the Service status is set to `Overridden`, either click `Inherit` to revert to the same setting as its parent, or click `Save` to keep the new setting, even if the parent setting changes.

   3. To turn on a service for a set of users across or within organizational units, select an access group. For details, go to [Use groups to customize service access](https://support.google.com/a/answer/9050643).
