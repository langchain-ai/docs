### *I can't create API keys or manage users in the UI, what's wrong?*

* You have likely deployed LangSmith without setting up SSO. LangSmith requires SSO to manage users and API keys. You can find more information on setting up SSO in the [configuration section.](/langsmith/self-host-sso)

### *How does load balancing/ingress work*?

* You will need to expose the frontend container/service to your applications/users. This will handle routing to all downstream services.
* You will need to terminate SSL at the ingress level. We recommend using a managed service like AWS ALB, GCP Load Balancer, or Nginx.

### *How can we authenticate to the application?*

* Currently, our self-hosted solution supports SSO with OAuth2.0 and OIDC as an authn solution. Note, we do offer a no-auth solution but highly recommend setting up oauth before moving into production.

You can find more information on setting up SSO in the [configuration section.](/langsmith/self-host-sso)

### *Can I use external storage services?*

* You can configure LangSmith to use external versions of all storage services. In a production setting, we strongly recommend using external storage services. Check out the [configuration section](/langsmith/architectural-overview) for more information.

### *Does my application need egress to function properly?*

Our deployment only needs egress for a few things (most of which can reside within your VPC):

* Fetching images (If mirroring your images, this may not be needed)

* Talking to any LLM endpoints

* Talking to any external storage services you may have configured

* Fetching OAuth information

* Subscription Metrics and Operational Metadata (if not running in offline mode)

  * Requires egress to `https://beacon.langchain.com`
  * See [Egress](/langsmith/self-host-egress) for more information

Your VPC can set up rules to limit any other access. Note: We require the `X-Organization-Id` and `X-Tenant-Id` headers to be allowed to be passed through to the backend service. These are used to determine which organization and workspace (previously called "tenant") the request is for.

### *Resource requirements for the application?*

* In kubernetes, we recommend a minimum helm configuration which can be found in [here](https://github.com/langchain-ai/helm/blob/main/charts/langsmith/examples/medium_size.yaml). For docker, we recommend a minimum of 16GB of RAM and 4 CPUs.
* For Postgres, we recommend a minimum of 8GB of RAM and 2 CPUs.
* For Redis, we recommend 4GB of RAM and 2 CPUs.
* For Clickhouse, we recommend 32GB of RAM and 8 CPUs.
