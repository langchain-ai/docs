    "**Map Reduce** chains enable efficient parallel processing of multiple documents by dividing the task into two stages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Map:** Each document is processed independently and concurrently—similar to having multiple readers analyze different books at the same time.\n",
    "2. **Reduce (optional):** The individual outputs are then aggregated into a single, cohesive result.\n",
    "\n",
    "This method is particularly valuable in two scenarios:\n",
    "\n",
    "* When processing **many large documents** that, together, would exceed the context window of a language model.\n",
    "* When documents are **independent** and can be processed in parallel to improve efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "By splitting the workload, Map Reduce helps scale processing while maintaining performance and coherence.\n",
