Trusted by companies shaping the future of agents – including Klarna, Replit, Elastic, and more – LangGraph is a low-level orchestration framework for building, managing, and deploying long-running, stateful agents.

To create an agent using prebuilt components:

1. Install LangGraph:

```
pip install -U langgraph
```

2. Create an agent using `create_react_agent`:

```python
# pip install -qU "langchain[anthropic]" to call the model

from langgraph.prebuilt import create_react_agent

def get_weather(city: str) -> str:
    """Get weather for a given city."""
    return f"It's always sunny in {city}!"

agent = create_react_agent(
    model="anthropic:claude-3-7-sonnet-latest",
    tools=[get_weather],
    prompt="You are a helpful assistant"
)

# Run the agent
agent.invoke(
    {"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "what is the weather in sf"}]}
)
```
