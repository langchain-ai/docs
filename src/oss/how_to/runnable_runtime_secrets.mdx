title: "How to pass runtime secrets to runnables"
---

<Info />

We can pass in secrets to our [runnables](/src/oss/concepts/runnables) at runtime using the `RunnableConfig`. Specifically we can pass in secrets with a `__` prefix to the `configurable` field. This will ensure that these secrets aren't traced as part of the invocation:

```
from langchain_core.runnables import RunnableConfigfrom langchain_core.tools import tool@tooldef foo(x: int, config: RunnableConfig) -> int:    """Sum x and a secret int"""    return x + config["configurable"]["__top_secret_int"]foo.invoke({"x": 5}, {"configurable": {"__top_secret_int": 2, "traced_key": "bar"}})
```

**API Reference:**[RunnableConfig](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/core/runnables/langchain_core.runnables.config.RunnableConfig.html) | [tool](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/core/tools/langchain_core.tools.convert.tool.html)

```

```

Looking at the LangSmith trace for this run, we can see that "traced\_key" was recorded (as part of Metadata) while our secret int was not: [https://smith.langchain.com/public/aa7e3289-49ca-422d-a408-f6b927210170/r](https://smith.langchain.com/public/aa7e3289-49ca-422d-a408-f6b927210170/r)
