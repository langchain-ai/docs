title: "How to cache LLM responses"
---

LangChain provides an optional [caching](/oss/concepts/chat_models/#caching) layer for LLMs. This is useful for two reasons:

It can save you money by reducing the number of API calls you make to the LLM provider, if you're often requesting the same completion multiple times. It can speed up your application by reducing the number of API calls you make to the LLM provider.

```
%pip install -qU langchain_openai langchain_communityimport osfrom getpass import getpassif "OPENAI_API_KEY" not in os.environ:    os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = getpass()# Please manually enter OpenAI Key
```

```
from langchain_core.globals import set_llm_cachefrom langchain_openai import OpenAI# To make the caching really obvious, let's use a slower and older model.# Caching supports newer chat models as well.llm = OpenAI(model="gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct", n=2, best_of=2)
