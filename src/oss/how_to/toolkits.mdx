title: "How to use toolkits"
---

Toolkits are collections of tools that are designed to be used together for specific tasks. They have convenient loading methods.

All Toolkits expose a `get_tools` method which returns a list of tools. You can therefore do:

```
# Initialize a toolkittoolkit = ExampleTookit(...)# Get list of toolstools = toolkit.get_tools()# Create agentagent = create_agent_method(llm, tools, prompt)
```
