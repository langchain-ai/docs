## [LangSmith](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/)

LangSmith allows you to closely trace, monitor and evaluate your LLM application.
It seamlessly integrates with LangChain and LangGraph.js, and you can use it to inspect and debug individual steps of your chains as you build.

LangSmith documentation is hosted on a separate site.
You can peruse [LangSmith how-to guides here](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/observability/how_to_guides), but we'll highlight a few sections that are particularly
relevant to LangChain below:

### Evaluation

<span data-heading-keywords="evaluation,evaluate"></span>

Evaluating performance is a vital part of building LLM-powered applications.
LangSmith helps with every step of the process from creating a dataset to defining metrics to running evaluators.

To learn more, check out the [LangSmith evaluation how-to guides](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/evaluation/how_to_guides).

### Tracing
