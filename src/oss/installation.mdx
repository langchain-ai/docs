To install the base LangGraph package:

:::python
```python
pip install -U langgraph
```
:::

:::js
```js
npm install @langchain/langgraph
```
:::

To use LangGraph you will usually want to access LLMs and define tools.
You can do this however you see fit.
One way to do this (which we will use in the docs) is to use LangChain.
You can install LangChain with:

:::python
```python
pip install -U langchain
```
:::

:::js
```js
npm install langchain
```
:::

To work with specific LLM provider packages, you will need install them one by one.
See the LLM integrations page for instructions on how to do that.
