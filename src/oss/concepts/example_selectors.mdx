## Overview

One common prompting technique for achieving better performance is to include examples as part of the prompt. This is known as [few-shot prompting](/oss/concepts/few_shot_prompting).

This gives the [language model](/oss/concepts/chat_models) concrete examples of how it should behave. Sometimes these examples are hardcoded into the prompt, but for more advanced situations it may be nice to dynamically select them.

**Example Selectors** are classes responsible for selecting and then formatting examples into prompts.
