**LangChain** is a framework for developing applications powered by large language models (LLMs).

LangChain simplifies every stage of the LLM application lifecycle:

* **Development**: Build your applications using LangChain's open-source [components](/oss/concepts) and [third-party integrations](/oss/integrations/providers). Use [LangGraph](/oss/concepts/architecture/#langgraph) to build stateful agents with first-class streaming and human-in-the-loop support.
* **Productionization**: Use [LangSmith](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/) to inspect, monitor and evaluate your applications, so that you can continuously optimize and deploy with confidence.
* **Deployment**: Turn your LangGraph applications into production-ready APIs and Assistants with [LangGraph Platform](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/cloud/).

LangChain implements a standard interface for large language models and related technologies, such as embedding models and vector stores, and integrates with hundreds of providers. See the [integrations](/oss/integrations/providers) page for more.

## Architecture

The LangChain framework consists of multiple open-source libraries. Read more in the [Architecture](/oss/concepts/architecture) page.

* **`langchain-core`**: Base abstractions for chat models and other components.
* **Integration packages** (e.g. `langchain-openai`, `langchain-anthropic`, etc.): Important integrations have been split into lightweight packages that are co-maintained by the LangChain team and the integration developers.
* **`langchain`**: Chains, agents, and retrieval strategies that make up an application's cognitive architecture.
* **`langchain-community`**: Third-party integrations that are community maintained.
* **`langgraph`**: Orchestration framework for combining LangChain components into production-ready applications with persistence, streaming, and other key features. See [LangGraph documentation](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/).

### Tutorials

If you're looking to build something specific or are more of a hands-on learner, check out our [tutorials section](/oss/tutorials). This is the best place to get started.

These are the best ones to get started with:

* [Build a Simple LLM Application](/oss/tutorials/llm_chain)
* [Build a Chatbot](/oss/tutorials/chatbot)
* [Build an Agent](/oss/tutorials/agents)
* [Introduction to LangGraph](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/tutorials/introduction/)

Explore the full list of LangChain tutorials [here](/oss/tutorials), and check out other [LangGraph tutorials here](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/tutorials/). To learn more about LangGraph, check out our first LangChain Academy course, *Introduction to LangGraph*, available [here](https://academy.langchain.com/courses/intro-to-langgraph).

### How-to guides

[Here](/oss/how_to) you‚Äôll find short answers to ‚ÄúHow do I‚Ä¶.?‚Äù types of questions. These how-to guides don‚Äôt cover topics in depth ‚Äì you‚Äôll find that material in the [Tutorials](/oss/tutorials) and the [API Reference](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/). However, these guides will help you quickly accomplish common tasks using [chat models](/oss/how_to/#chat-models), [vector stores](/oss/how_to/#vector-stores), and other common LangChain components.

Check out [LangGraph-specific how-tos here](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/how-tos/).

### Conceptual guide

Introductions to all the key parts of LangChain you‚Äôll need to know! [Here](/oss/concepts) you'll find high level explanations of all LangChain concepts.

### Integrations

LangChain is part of a rich ecosystem of tools that integrate with our framework and build on top of it. If you're looking to get up and running quickly with [chat models](/oss/integrations/chat), [vector stores](/oss/integrations/vectorstores), or other LangChain components from a specific provider, check out our growing list of [integrations](/oss/integrations/providers).

### API reference

Head to the reference section for full documentation of all classes and methods in the LangChain Python packages.

## Ecosystem

### ü¶úüõ†Ô∏è LangSmith

Trace and evaluate your language model applications and intelligent agents to help you move from prototype to production.

### ü¶úüï∏Ô∏è LangGraph

Build stateful, multi-actor applications with LLMs. Integrates smoothly with LangChain, but can be used without it. LangGraph powers production-grade agents, trusted by Linkedin, Uber, Klarna, GitLab, and many more.
