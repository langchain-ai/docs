A single agent might struggle if it needs to specialize in multiple domains or manage many tools. To tackle this, you can break your agent into smaller, independent agents and compose them into a [multi-agent system](/oss/multi-agent).

In multi-agent systems, agents need to communicate between each other. They do so via [handoffs](#handoffs) — a primitive that describes which agent to hand control to and the payload to send to that agent.

Two of the most popular multi-agent architectures are:

* [supervisor](#supervisor) — individual agents are coordinated by a central supervisor agent. The supervisor controls all communication flow and task delegation, making decisions about which agent to invoke based on the current context and task requirements.
* [swarm](#swarm) — agents dynamically hand off control to one another based on their specializations. The system remembers which agent was last active, ensuring that on subsequent interactions, the conversation resumes with that agent.

## Supervisor

## Handoffs

A common pattern in multi-agent interactions is **handoffs**, where one agent _hands off_ control to another. Handoffs allow you to specify:

* **destination**: target agent to navigate to
* **payload**: information to pass to that agent

:::python
This is used both by `langgraph-supervisor` (supervisor hands off to individual agents) and `langgraph-swarm` (an individual agent can hand off to other agents).

To implement handoffs with `create_react_agent`, you need to:

1. Create a special tool that can transfer control to a different agent
  ```python {highlight={5,7,10}}
  def transfer_to_bob():
      """Transfer to bob."""
      return Command(
          # name of the agent (node) to go to
          goto="bob",
          # data to send to the agent
          update={"messages": [...]},
          # indicate to LangGraph that we need to navigate to
          # agent node in a parent graph
          graph=Command.PARENT,
      )
```
2. Create individual agents that have access to handoff tools:
  ```python
  flight_assistant = create_react_agent(
      ..., tools=[book_flight, transfer_to_hotel_assistant]
  )
  hotel_assistant = create_react_agent(
      ..., tools=[book_hotel, transfer_to_flight_assistant]
  )
  ```
3. Define a parent graph that contains individual agents as nodes:
  ```python
  from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, MessagesState
  multi_agent_graph = (
      StateGraph(MessagesState)
      .add_node(flight_assistant)
      .add_node(hotel_assistant)
      ...
  )
  ```
:::

:::js
This is used both by `@langchain/langgraph-supervisor` (supervisor hands off to individual agents) and `@langchain/langgraph-swarm` (an individual agent can hand off to other agents).

To implement handoffs with `createReactAgent`, you need to:

1. Create a special tool that can transfer control to a different agent
  ```python {highlight={5,7,10}}
  function transferToBob() {
    /**Transfer to bob.*/
    return new Command({
      // name of the agent (node) to go to
      goto: "bob",
      // data to send to the agent
      update: { messages: [...] },
      // indicate to LangGraph that we need to navigate to
      // agent node in a parent graph
      graph: Command.PARENT,
    });
  }
```
2. Create individual agents that have access to handoff tools:
  ```typescript
  const flightAssistant = createReactAgent({
    ..., tools: [bookFlight, transferToHotelAssistant]
  });
  const hotelAssistant = createReactAgent({
    ..., tools: [bookHotel, transferToFlightAssistant]
  });
  ```
3. Define a parent graph that contains individual agents as nodes:
  ```typescript
  import { StateGraph, MessagesZodState } from "@langchain/langgraph";
  const multiAgentGraph = new StateGraph(MessagesZodState)
    .addNode("flight_assistant", flightAssistant)
    .addNode("hotel_assistant", hotelAssistant)
    // ...
  ```

Putting this together, here is how you can implement a simple multi-agent system with two agents — a flight booking assistant and a hotel booking assistant:

:::python
```python {highlight={13,14,23,24,25,51,53,57,59}}
from typing import Annotated
from langchain_core.tools import tool, InjectedToolCallId

from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, MessagesState
from langgraph.types import Command

def create_handoff_tool(*, agent_name: str, description: str | None = None):
    name = f"transfer_to_{agent_name}"
    description = description or f"Transfer to {agent_name}"

    @tool(name, description=description)
    def handoff_tool(
        state: Annotated[MessagesState, InjectedState], # (1)!
        tool_call_id: Annotated[str, InjectedToolCallId],
    ) -> Command:
        tool_message = {
            "role": "tool",
            "content": f"Successfully transferred to {agent_name}",
            "name": name,
            "tool_call_id": tool_call_id,
        }
        return Command(  # (2)!
            goto=agent_name,  # (3)!
            update={"messages": state["messages"] + [tool_message]},  # (4)!
            graph=Command.PARENT,  # (5)!
        )
    return handoff_tool

# Handoffs
transfer_to_hotel_assistant = create_handoff_tool(
    agent_name="hotel_assistant",
    description="Transfer user to the hotel-booking assistant.",
)
transfer_to_flight_assistant = create_handoff_tool(
    agent_name="flight_assistant",
    description="Transfer user to the flight-booking assistant.",
)

# Simple agent tools
def book_hotel(hotel_name: str):
    """Book a hotel"""
    return f"Successfully booked a stay at {hotel_name}."

def book_flight(from_airport: str, to_airport: str):
    """Book a flight"""
    return f"Successfully booked a flight from {from_airport} to {to_airport}."

# Define agents
flight_assistant = create_react_agent(
    model="anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-latest",
    tools=[book_flight, transfer_to_hotel_assistant],
    prompt="You are a flight booking assistant",
    name="flight_assistant"
)
hotel_assistant = create_react_agent(
    model="anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-latest",
    tools=[book_hotel, transfer_to_flight_assistant],
    prompt="You are a hotel booking assistant",
    name="hotel_assistant"
)

# Define multi-agent graph
multi_agent_graph = (
    StateGraph(MessagesState)
    .add_node(flight_assistant)
    .add_node(hotel_assistant)
    .add_edge(START, "flight_assistant")
    .compile()
)

# Run the multi-agent graph
for chunk in multi_agent_graph.stream(
    {
        "messages": [
            {
                "role": "user",
                "content": "book a flight from BOS to JFK and a stay at McKittrick Hotel"
            }
        ]
    }
):
    print(chunk)
    print("\n")
```

1. Access agent's state
2. The `Command` primitive allows specifying a state update and a node transition as a single operation, making it useful for implementing handoffs.
3. Name of the agent or node to hand off to.
4. Take the agent's messages and **add** them to the parent's **state** as part of the handoff. The next agent will see the parent state.
5. Indicate to LangGraph that we need to navigate to agent node in a **parent** multi-agent graph.

<Note>
  This handoff implementation assumes that:
  
  * each agent receives overall message history (across all agents) in the multi-agent system as its input
  * each agent outputs its internal messages history to the overall message history of the multi-agent system
