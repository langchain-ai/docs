## Setup

### Credentials

No credentials are required to use `PyPDFLoader`.

To enable automated tracing of your model calls, set your [LangSmith](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/) API key:

```
# os.environ["LANGSMITH_API_KEY"] = getpass.getpass("Enter your LangSmith API key: ")# os.environ["LANGSMITH_TRACING"] = "true"
```

### Installation

Install **langchain\_community** and **pypdf**.

```
%pip install -qU langchain_community pypdf
```

```
Note: you may need to restart the kernel to use updated packages.
```

## Initialization

Now we can instantiate our model object and load documents:

```
from langchain_community.document_loaders import PyPDFLoaderfile_path = "./example_data/layout-parser-paper.pdf"loader = PyPDFLoader(file_path)
```

LayoutParser: A Uniﬁed Toolkit for DL-Based DIA 11focuses on precision, eﬃciency, and robustness. T{'producer': 'pdfTeX-1.40.21', 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref', 'creationdate': '2021-06-22T01:27:10+00:00', 'author': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2021-06-22T01:27:10+00:00', 'ptex.fullbanner': 'This is pdfTeX, Version 3.14159265-2.6-1.40.21 (TeX Live '                    '2020) kpathsea version 6.3.2', 'subject': '', 'title': '', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': './example_data/layout-parser-paper.pdf', 'total_pages': 16, 'page': 10, 'page_label': '11'}
```

The metadata attribute contains at least the following keys:

* source
* page (if in mode *page*)
* total\_page
* creationdate
* creator
* producer

Additional metadata are specific to each parser. These pieces of information can be helpful (to categorize your PDFs for example).

## Splitting mode & custom pages delimiter

When loading the PDF file you can split it in two different ways:

* By page
* As a single text flow

By default PyPDFLoader will split the PDF as a single text flow.

### Extract the PDF by page. Each page is extracted as a langchain Document object:

```
loader = PyPDFLoader(    "./example_data/layout-parser-paper.pdf",    mode="page",)docs = loader.load()print(len(docs))pprint.pp(docs[0].metadata)
```

```

```

In this mode the pdf is split by pages and the resulting Documents metadata contains the page number. But in some cases we could want to process the pdf as a single text flow (so we don't cut some paragraphs in half). In this case you can use the *single* mode :

### Extract the whole PDF as a single langchain Document object:

```
loader = PyPDFLoader(    "./example_data/layout-parser-paper.pdf",    mode="single",)docs = loader.load()print(len(docs))pprint.pp(docs[0].metadata)
```

```
1{'producer': 'pdfTeX-1.40.21', 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref', 'creationdate': '2021-06-22T01:27:10+00:00', 'author': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2021-06-22T01:27:10+00:00', 'ptex.fullbanner': 'This is pdfTeX, Version 3.14159265-2.6-1.40.21 (TeX Live '                    '2020) kpathsea version 6.3.2', 'subject': '', 'title': '', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': './example_data/layout-parser-paper.pdf', 'total_pages': 16}
```

Logically, in this mode, the ‘page\_number’ metadata disappears. Here's how to clearly identify where pages end in the text flow :

### Add a custom *pages\_delimiter* to identify where are ends of pages in *single* mode:

```
loader = PyPDFLoader(    "./example_data/layout-parser-paper.pdf",    mode="single",    pages_delimiter="\n-------THIS IS A CUSTOM END OF PAGE-------\n",)docs = loader.load()print(docs[0].page_content[:5780])
```

```

Shen et al.37], layout detection [38, 22], table detection [ 26], and scene text detection [ 4].A generalized learning-based framework dramatically reduces the need for themanual speciﬁcation of complicated rules, which is the status quo with traditionalmethods. DL has the potential to transform DIA pipelines and beneﬁt a broadspectrum of large-scale document digitization projects.However, there are several practical diﬃculties for taking advantages of re-cent advances in DL-based methods: 1) DL models are notoriously convolutedfor reuse and extension. Existing models are developed using distinct frame-works like TensorFlow [1] or PyTorch [ 24], and the high-level parameters canbe obfuscated by implementation details [ 8]. It can be a time-consuming andfrustrating experience to debug, reproduce, and adapt existing models for DIA,and many researchers who would beneﬁt the most from using these methods lackthe technical background to implement them from scratch. 2) Document imagescontain diverse and disparate patterns across domains, and customized trainingis often required to achieve a desirable detection accuracy. Currently there is nofull-ﬂedged infrastructure for easily curating the target document image datasetsand ﬁne-tuning or re-training the models. 3) DIA usually requires a sequence ofmodels and other processing to obtain the ﬁnal outputs. Often research teams useDL models and then perform further document analyses in separate processes,and these pipelines are not documented in any central location (and often notdocumented at all). This makes it diﬃcult for research teams to learn about howfull pipelines are implemented and leads them to invest signiﬁcant resources inreinventing the DIA wheel .LayoutParser provides a uniﬁed toolkit to support DL-based document imageanalysis and processing. To address the aforementioned challenges,LayoutParseris built with the following components:1. An oﬀ-the-shelf toolkit for applying DL models for layout detection, characterrecognition, and other DIA tasks (Section 3)2. A rich repository of pre-trained neural network models (Model Zoo) thatunderlies the oﬀ-the-shelf usage3. Comprehensive tools for eﬃcient document image data annotation and modeltuning to support diﬀerent levels of customization4. A DL model hub and community platform for the easy sharing, distribu-tion, and discussion of DIA models and pipelines, to promote reusability,reproducibility, and extensibility (Section 4)The library implements simple and intuitive Python APIs without sacriﬁcinggeneralizability and versatility, and can be easily installed via pip. Its convenientfunctions for handling document image data can be seamlessly integrated withexisting DIA pipelines. With detailed documentations and carefully curatedtutorials, we hope this tool will beneﬁt a variety of end-users, and will lead toadvances in applications in both industry and academic research.LayoutParser is well aligned with recent eﬀorts for improving DL modelreusability in other disciplines like natural language processing [ 8, 34] and com-puter vision [ 35], but with a focus on unique challenges in DIA.

# Extract images from the PDF

You can extract images from your PDFs with a choice of three different solutions:

* rapidOCR (lightweight Optical Character Recognition tool)
* Tesseract (OCR tool with high precision)
* Multimodal language model

You can tune these functions to choose the output format of the extracted images among *html*, *markdown* or *text*

The result is inserted between the last and the second-to-last paragraphs of text of the page.

### Extract images from the PDF with rapidOCR:

```
%pip install -qU rapidocr-onnxruntime
```

```
Note: you may need to restart the kernel to use updated packages.
```

Traditionally, this requires exporting DL model outputs and then loadingthe results into other pipelines.

## Working with Files

Many document loaders involve parsing files. The difference between such loaders usually stems from how the file is parsed, rather than how the file is loaded. For example, you can use `open` to read the binary content of either a PDF or a markdown file, but you need different parsing logic to convert that binary data into text.

As a result, it can be helpful to decouple the parsing logic from the loading logic, which makes it easier to re-use a given parser regardless of how the data was loaded. You can use this strategy to analyze different files, with the same parsing parameters.
