> [Tencent Cloud Object Storage (COS)](https://www.tencentcloud.com/products/cos) is a distributed storage service that enables you to store any amount of data from anywhere via HTTP/HTTPS protocols. `COS` has no restrictions on data structure or format. It also has no bucket size limit and partition management, making it suitable for virtually any use case, such as data delivery, data processing, and data lakes. `COS` provides a web-based console, multi-language SDKs and APIs, command line tool, and graphical tools. It works well with Amazon S3 APIs, allowing you to quickly access community tools and plugins.

This covers how to load document objects from a `Tencent COS Directory`.

```
%pip install --upgrade --quiet  cos-python-sdk-v5
```

```
from langchain_community.document_loaders import TencentCOSDirectoryLoaderfrom qcloud_cos import CosConfig
```

**API Reference:**[TencentCOSDirectoryLoader](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/community/document_loaders/langchain_community.document_loaders.tencent_cos_directory.TencentCOSDirectoryLoader.html)

```
conf = CosConfig(    Region="your cos region",    SecretId="your cos secret_id",    SecretKey="your cos secret_key",)loader = TencentCOSDirectoryLoader(conf=conf, bucket="you_cos_bucket")
```

```
loader.load()
```

## Specifying a prefix

You can also specify a prefix for more fine-grained control over what files to load.

```
loader = TencentCOSDirectoryLoader(conf=conf, bucket="you_cos_bucket", prefix="fake")
```

```
loader.load()
```
