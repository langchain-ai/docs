> [GitBook](https://docs.gitbook.com/) is a modern documentation platform where teams can document everything from products to internal knowledge bases and APIs.

This notebook shows how to pull page data from any `GitBook`.

```
from langchain_community.document_loaders import GitbookLoader
```

**API Reference:**[GitbookLoader](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/community/document_loaders/langchain_community.document_loaders.gitbook.GitbookLoader.html)

### Load from single GitBook page

```
loader = GitbookLoader("https://docs.gitbook.com")
```

```
page_data = loader.load()
```

```

### Load from all paths in a given GitBook

For this to work, the GitbookLoader needs to be initialized with the root path (`https://docs.gitbook.com` in this example) and have `load_all_paths` set to `True`.

```
loader = GitbookLoader("https://docs.gitbook.com", load_all_paths=True)all_pages_data = loader.load()
```
