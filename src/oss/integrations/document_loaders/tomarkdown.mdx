**LangChain** is a framework for developing applications powered by language models. It enables applications that:- **Are context-aware**: connect a language model to sources of context (prompt instructions, few shot examples, content to ground its response in, etc.)- **Reason**: rely on a language model to reason (about how to answer based on provided context, what actions to take, etc.)This framework consists of several parts.- **LangChain Libraries**: The Python and JavaScript libraries. Contains interfaces and integrations for a myriad of components, a basic run time for combining these components into chains and agents, and off-the-shelf implementations of chains and agents.- **[LangChain Templates](/src/oss/templates)**: A collection of easily deployable reference architectures for a wide variety of tasks.- **[LangServe](/src/oss/langserve)**: A library for deploying LangChain chains as a REST API.- **[LangSmith](https://docs.smith.langchain.com)**: A developer platform that lets you debug, test, evaluate, and monitor chains built on any LLM framework and seamlessly integrates with LangChain.![Diagram outlining the hierarchical organization of the LangChain framework, displaying the interconnected parts across multiple layers.](https://python.langchain.com/assets/images/langchain_stack-f21828069f74484521f38199910007c1.svg)Together, these products simplify the entire application lifecycle:- **Develop**: Write your applications in LangChain/LangChain.js. Hit the ground running using Templates for reference.- **Productionize**: Use LangSmith to inspect, test and monitor your chains, so that you can constantly improve and deploy with confidence.- **Deploy**: Turn any chain into an API with LangServe.## LangChain Libraries [​](/src/oss/../../\#langchain-libraries "Direct link to LangChain Libraries")The main value props of the LangChain packages are:1. **Components**: composable tools and integrations for working with language models. Components are modular and easy-to-use, whether you are using the rest of the LangChain framework or not2. **Off-the-shelf chains**: built-in assemblages of components for accomplishing higher-level tasksOff-the-shelf chains make it easy to get started. Components make it easy to customize existing chains and build new ones.The LangChain libraries themselves are made up of several different packages.- **`langchain-core`**: Base abstractions and LangChain Expression Language.- **`langchain-community`**: Third party integrations.- **`langchain`**: Chains, agents, and retrieval strategies that make up an application's cognitive architecture.## Get started [​](/src/oss/../../\#get-started "Direct link to Get started")[Here’s](/src/oss/installation) how to install LangChain, set up your environment, and start building.We recommend following our [Quickstart](/src/oss/tutorials/llm_chain) guide to familiarize yourself with the framework by building your first LangChain application.Read up on our [Security](/src/oss/security) best practices to make sure you're developing safely with LangChain.noteThese docs focus on the Python LangChain library. [Head here](https://js.langchain.com) for docs on the JavaScript LangChain library.## LangChain Expression Language (LCEL) [​](/src/oss/../../\#langchain-expression-language-lcel "Direct link to LangChain Expression Language (LCEL)")LCEL is a declarative way to compose chains. LCEL was designed from day 1 to support putting prototypes in production, with no code changes, from the simplest “prompt + LLM” chain to the most complex chains.- **[Overview](/src/oss/concepts/lcel)**: LCEL and its benefits- **[Interface](/src/oss/concepts/runnables)**: The standard interface for LCEL objects- **[How-to](/src/oss/expression_language/how_to)**: Key features of LCEL- **[Cookbook](/src/oss/expression_language/cookbook)**: Example code for accomplishing common tasks## Modules [​](/src/oss/../../\#modules "Direct link to Modules")LangChain provides standard, extendable interfaces and integrations for the following modules:#### [Model I/O](/src/oss/modules/model_io) [​](/src/oss/../../\#model-io "Direct link to model-io")Interface with language models#### [Retrieval](/src/oss/modules/data_connection) [​](/src/oss/../../\#retrieval "Direct link to retrieval")Interface with application-specific data#### [Agents](/src/oss/tutorials/agents) [​](/src/oss/../../\#agents "Direct link to agents")Let models choose which tools to use given high-level directives## Examples, ecosystem, and resources [​](/src/oss/../../\#examples-ecosystem-and-resources "Direct link to Examples, ecosystem, and resources")### [Use cases](/src/oss/how_to#qa-with-rag) [​](/src/oss/../../\#use-cases "Direct link to use-cases")Walkthroughs and techniques for common end-to-end use cases, like:- [Document question answering](/src/oss/how_to#qa-with-rag)- [Chatbots](/src/oss/use_cases/chatbots)- [Analyzing structured data](/src/oss/how_to#qa-over-sql--csv)- and much more...### [Integrations](/src/oss/integrations/providers) [​](/src/oss/../../\#integrations "Direct link to integrations")LangChain is part of a rich ecosystem of tools that integrate with our framework and build on top of it.
