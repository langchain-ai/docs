This notebook covers how to load documents from a Zipfile generated from a `Slack` export.

In order to get this `Slack` export, follow these instructions:

## ðŸ§‘ Instructions for ingesting your own dataset

Export your Slack data. You can do this by going to your Workspace Management page and clicking the Import/Export option (\{your\_slack\_domain}.slack.com/services/export). Then, choose the right date range and click `Start export`. Slack will send you an email and a DM when the export is ready.

The download will produce a `.zip` file in your Downloads folder (or wherever your downloads can be found, depending on your OS configuration).

Copy the path to the `.zip` file, and assign it as `LOCAL_ZIPFILE` below.

```
from langchain_community.document_loaders import SlackDirectoryLoader
```

**API Reference:**[SlackDirectoryLoader](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/community/document_loaders/langchain_community.document_loaders.slack_directory.SlackDirectoryLoader.html)

```
# Optionally set your Slack URL. This will give you proper URLs in the docs sources.SLACK_WORKSPACE_URL = "https://xxx.slack.com"LOCAL_ZIPFILE = ""  # Paste the local path to your Slack zip file here.loader = SlackDirectoryLoader(LOCAL_ZIPFILE, SLACK_WORKSPACE_URL)
```

```
docs = loader.load()docs
```
