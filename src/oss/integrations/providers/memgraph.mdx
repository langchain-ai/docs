> Memgraph is a high-performance, in-memory graph database that is optimized for real-time queries and analytics. Get started with Memgraph by visiting [their website](https://memgraph.com/).

## Installation and Setup

* Install the Python SDK with `pip install langchain-memgraph`

## MemgraphQAChain

There exists a wrapper around Memgraph graph database that allows you to generate Cypher statements based on the user input and use them to retrieve relevant information from the database.

```
from langchain_memgraph.chains.graph_qa import MemgraphQAChainfrom langchain_memgraph.graphs.memgraph import MemgraphLangChain
```

See a [usage example](/src/oss/integrations/graphs/memgraph)

## Constructing a Knowledge Graph from unstructured data

You can use the integration to construct a knowledge graph from unstructured data.

```
from langchain_memgraph.graphs.memgraph import MemgraphLangChainfrom langchain_experimental.graph_transformers import LLMGraphTransformer
```

**API Reference:**[LLMGraphTransformer](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/experimental/graph_transformers/langchain_experimental.graph_transformers.llm.LLMGraphTransformer.html)

See a [usage example](/src/oss/integrations/graphs/memgraph)

## Memgraph Tools and Toolkit

Memgraph also provides a toolkit that allows you to interact with the Memgraph database. See a [usage example](/src/oss/integrations/tools/memgraph).

```
from langchain_memgraph import MemgraphToolkit
```
