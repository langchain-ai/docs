GROBID is a machine learning library for extracting, parsing, and re-structuring raw documents.

It is designed and expected to be used to parse academic papers, where it works particularly well.

*Note*: if the articles supplied to Grobid are large documents (e.g. dissertations) exceeding a certain number of elements, they might not be processed.

This page covers how to use the Grobid to parse articles for LangChain.

## Installation

The grobid installation is described in details in [https://grobid.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Install-Grobid/](https://grobid.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Install-Grobid/). However, it is probably easier and less troublesome to run grobid through a docker container, as documented [here](https://grobid.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Grobid-docker/).

## Use Grobid with LangChain

Once grobid is installed and up and running (you can check by accessing it [http://localhost:8070](http://localhost:8070)), you're ready to go.

You can now use the GrobidParser to produce documents

```
from langchain_community.document_loaders.parsers import GrobidParserfrom langchain_community.document_loaders.generic import GenericLoader#Produce chunks from article paragraphsloader = GenericLoader.from_filesystem(    "/Users/31treehaus/Desktop/Papers/",    glob="*",    suffixes=[".pdf"],    parser= GrobidParser(segment_sentences=False))docs = loader.load()#Produce chunks from article sentencesloader = GenericLoader.from_filesystem(    "/Users/31treehaus/Desktop/Papers/",    glob="*",    suffixes=[".pdf"],    parser= GrobidParser(segment_sentences=True))docs = loader.load()
```

**API Reference:**[GrobidParser](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/community/document_loaders/langchain_community.document_loaders.parsers.grobid.GrobidParser.html) | [GenericLoader](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/community/document_loaders/langchain_community.document_loaders.generic.GenericLoader.html)

Chunk metadata will include Bounding Boxes. Although these are a bit funky to parse, they are explained in [https://grobid.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Coordinates-in-PDF/](https://grobid.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Coordinates-in-PDF/)
