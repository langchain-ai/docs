> [Weights & Biases](https://wandb.ai/) is provider of the AI developer platform to train and fine-tune AI models and develop AI applications.

`Weights & Biase` products can be used to log metrics and artifacts during training, and to trace the execution of your code.

There are several main ways to use `Weights & Biases` products within LangChain:

* with `wandb_tracing_enabled`
* with `Weave` lightweight toolkit
* with `WandbCallbackHandler` (deprecated)

## wandb\_tracing\_enabled

See a [usage example](/oss/integrations/providers/wandb_tracing).

See in the [W\&B documentation](https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/integrations/langchain).

```
from langchain_community.callbacks import wandb_tracing_enabled
```

**API Reference:**[wandb\_tracing\_enabled](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/community/callbacks/langchain_community.callbacks.manager.wandb_tracing_enabled.html)

## Weave

See in the [W\&B documentation](https://weave-docs.wandb.ai/guides/integrations/langchain).

## WandbCallbackHandler

**Note:** the `WandbCallbackHandler` is being deprecated in favour of the `wandb_tracing_enabled`.

See a [usage example](/oss/integrations/providers/wandb_tracking).

See in the [W\&B documentation](https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/integrations/langchain).

```
from langchain_community.callbacks import WandbCallbackHandler
```

**API Reference:**[WandbCallbackHandler](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/community/callbacks/langchain_community.callbacks.wandb_callback.WandbCallbackHandler.html)
