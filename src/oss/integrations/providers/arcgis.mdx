> [ArcGIS](https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis/about-arcgis/overview) is a family of client, server and online geographic information system software developed and maintained by [Esri](https://www.esri.com/).
>
> `ArcGISLoader` uses the `arcgis` package. `arcgis` is a Python library for the vector and raster analysis, geocoding, map making, routing and directions. It administers, organizes and manages users, groups and information items in your GIS. It enables access to ready-to-use maps and curated geographic data from `Esri` and other authoritative sources, and works with your own data as well.

## Installation and Setup

We have to install the `arcgis` package.

```
pip install -U arcgis
```

## Document Loader

See a [usage example](/oss/integrations/document_loaders/arcgis).

```
