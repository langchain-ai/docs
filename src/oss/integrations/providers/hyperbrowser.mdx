## Available Tools

Hyperbrowser provides two main categories of tools that are particularly useful for:

* Web scraping and data extraction from complex websites
* Automating repetitive web tasks
* Interacting with web applications that require authentication
* Performing research across multiple websites
* Testing web applications

### Browser Agent Tools

Hyperbrowser provides a number of Browser Agents tools. Currently we supported

* Claude Computer Use
* OpenAI CUA
* Browser Use

You can see more details [here](/oss/integrations/tools/hyperbrowser_browser_agent_tools)

#### Browser Use Tool

A general-purpose browser automation tool that can handle various web tasks through natural language instructions.

```
from langchain_hyperbrowser import HyperbrowserBrowserUseTooltool = HyperbrowserBrowserUseTool()result = tool.run({    "task": "Go to npmjs.com, find the React package, and tell me when it was last updated"})print(result)
```

#### OpenAI CUA Tool

Leverages OpenAI's Computer Use Agent capabilities for advanced web interactions and information gathering.

```
from langchain_hyperbrowser import HyperbrowserOpenAICUATooltool = HyperbrowserOpenAICUATool()result = tool.run({    "task": "Go to Hacker News and summarize the top 5 posts right now"})print(result)
```

#### Claude Computer Use Tool

Utilizes Anthropic's Claude for sophisticated web browsing and information processing tasks.

```
from langchain_hyperbrowser import HyperbrowserClaudeComputerUseTooltool = HyperbrowserClaudeComputerUseTool()result = tool.run({    "task": "Go to GitHub's trending repositories page, and list the top 3 posts there right now"})print(result)
```

### Web Scraping Tools

Here is a brief description of the Web Scraping Tools available with Hyperbrowser. You can see more details [here](/oss/integrations/tools/hyperbrowser_web_scraping_tools)

#### Scrape Tool

The Scrape Tool allows you to extract content from a single webpage in markdown, HTML, or link format.

```
from langchain_hyperbrowser import HyperbrowserScrapeTooltool = HyperbrowserScrapeTool()result = tool.run({    "url": "https://example.com",    "scrape_options": {"formats": ["markdown"]}})print(result)
```

#### Crawl Tool

The Crawl Tool enables you to traverse entire websites, starting from a given URL, with configurable page limits.

```
from langchain_hyperbrowser import HyperbrowserCrawlTooltool = HyperbrowserCrawlTool()result = tool.run({    "url": "https://example.com",    "max_pages": 2,    "scrape_options": {"formats": ["markdown"]}})print(result)
```

#### Extract Tool

The Extract Tool uses AI to pull structured data from web pages based on predefined schemas, making it perfect for data extraction tasks.

```
from langchain_hyperbrowser import HyperbrowserExtractToolfrom pydantic import BaseModelclass SimpleExtractionModel(BaseModel):    title: strtool = HyperbrowserExtractTool()result = tool.run({    "url": "https://example.com",    "schema": SimpleExtractionModel})print(result)
```

## Document Loader

The `HyperbrowserLoader` class in `langchain-hyperbrowser` can easily be used to load content from any single page or multiple pages as well as crawl an entire site. The content can be loaded as markdown or html.

```
from langchain_hyperbrowser import HyperbrowserLoaderloader = HyperbrowserLoader(urls="https://example.com")docs = loader.load()print(docs[0])
```

### Advanced Usage

You can specify the operation to be performed by the loader. The default operation is `scrape`. For `scrape`, you can provide a single URL or a list of URLs to be scraped. For `crawl`, you can only provide a single URL. The `crawl` operation will crawl the provided page and subpages and return a document for each page.

```
loader = HyperbrowserLoader(  urls="https://hyperbrowser.ai", api_key="YOUR_API_KEY", operation="crawl")
```

Optional params for the loader can also be provided in the `params` argument. For more information on the supported params, visit [https://docs.hyperbrowser.ai/reference/sdks/python/scrape#start-scrape-job-and-wait](https://docs.hyperbrowser.ai/reference/sdks/python/scrape#start-scrape-job-and-wait) or [https://docs.hyperbrowser.ai/reference/sdks/python/crawl#start-crawl-job-and-wait](https://docs.hyperbrowser.ai/reference/sdks/python/crawl#start-crawl-job-and-wait).

```
loader = HyperbrowserLoader(  urls="https://example.com",  api_key="YOUR_API_KEY",  operation="scrape",  params={"scrape_options": {"include_tags": ["h1", "h2", "p"]}})
```
