> [Beijing Academy of Artificial Intelligence (BAAI) (Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing_Academy_of_Artificial_Intelligence), also known as `Zhiyuan Institute`, is a Chinese non-profit artificial intelligence (AI) research laboratory. `BAAI` conducts AI research and is dedicated to promoting collaboration among academia and industry, as well as fostering top talent and a focus on long-term research on the fundamentals of AI technology. As a collaborative hub, BAAI's founding members include leading AI companies, universities, and research institutes.

## Embedding Models

### HuggingFaceBgeEmbeddings

> [BGE models on the HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/BAAI/bge-large-en-v1.5) are one of [the best open-source embedding models](https://huggingface.co/spaces/mteb/leaderboard).

See a [usage example](/src/oss/integrations/text_embedding/bge_huggingface).

```
from langchain_community.embeddings import HuggingFaceBgeEmbeddings
```

**API Reference:**[HuggingFaceBgeEmbeddings](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/community/embeddings/langchain_community.embeddings.huggingface.HuggingFaceBgeEmbeddings.html)

### IpexLLMBgeEmbeddings

> [IPEX-LLM](https://github.com/intel-analytics/ipex-llm) is a PyTorch library for running LLM on Intel CPU and GPU (e.g., local PC with iGPU, discrete GPU such as Arc, Flex and Max) with very low latency.

See a [usage example running model on Intel CPU](/src/oss/integrations/text_embedding/ipex_llm). See a [usage example running model on Intel GPU](/src/oss/integrations/text_embedding/ipex_llm_gpu).

```
from langchain_community.embeddings import IpexLLMBgeEmbeddings
```
