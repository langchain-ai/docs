> [Stack Exchange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_Exchange) is a network of question-and-answer (Q\&A) websites on topics in diverse fields, each site covering a specific topic, where questions, answers, and users are subject to a reputation award process.

This page covers how to use the `Stack Exchange API` within LangChain.

## Installation and Setup

* Install requirements with

```
pip install stackapi
```

## Wrappers

### Utility

There exists a StackExchangeAPIWrapper utility which wraps this API. To import this utility:

```
from langchain_community.utilities import StackExchangeAPIWrapper
```

**API Reference:**[StackExchangeAPIWrapper](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/community/utilities/langchain_community.utilities.stackexchange.StackExchangeAPIWrapper.html)

For a more detailed walkthrough of this wrapper, see [this notebook](/oss/integrations/tools/stackexchange).

### Tool

You can also easily load this wrapper as a Tool (to use with an Agent). You can do this with:

```
from langchain_community.agent_toolkits.load_tools import load_toolstools = load_tools(["stackexchange"])
```
