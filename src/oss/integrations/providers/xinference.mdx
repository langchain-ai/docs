title: "Xorbits Inference (Xinference)"

This page demonstrates how to use [Xinference](https://github.com/xorbitsai/inference) with LangChain.

`Xinference` is a powerful and versatile library designed to serve LLMs, speech recognition models, and multimodal models, even on your laptop. With Xorbits Inference, you can effortlessly deploy and serve your or state-of-the-art built-in models using just a single command.

## Installation and Setup

Xinference can be installed via pip from PyPI:

```
pip install "xinference[all]"
```

## LLM

Xinference supports various models compatible with GGML, including chatglm, baichuan, whisper, vicuna, and orca. To view the builtin models, run the command:

```
xinference list --all
```

### Wrapper for Xinference

You can start a local instance of Xinference by running:

```
xinference
```

You can also deploy Xinference in a distributed cluster. To do so, first start an Xinference supervisor on the server you want to run it:

```
xinference-supervisor -H "${supervisor_host}"
```

Then, start the Xinference workers on each of the other servers where you want to run them on:

```
xinference-worker -e "http://${supervisor_host}:9997"
```

You can also start a local instance of Xinference by running:

```
xinference
```

Once Xinference is running, an endpoint will be accessible for model management via CLI or Xinference client.

For local deployment, the endpoint will be [http://localhost:9997](http://localhost:9997).

For cluster deployment, the endpoint will be http\://$\{supervisor\_host}:9997.

Then, you need to launch a model. You can specify the model names and other attributes including model\_size\_in\_billions and quantization. You can use command line interface (CLI) to do it. For example,

```
xinference launch -n orca -s 3 -q q4_0
```

A model uid will be returned.

Example usage:

```
from langchain_community.llms import Xinferencellm = Xinference(    server_url="http://0.0.0.0:9997",    model_uid = {model_uid} # replace model_uid with the model UID return from launching the model)llm(    prompt="Q: where can we visit in the capital of France? A:",    generate_config={"max_tokens": 1024, "stream": True},)
```
