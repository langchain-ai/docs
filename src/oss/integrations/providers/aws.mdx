## Chat models

### Bedrock Chat

> [Amazon Bedrock](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/) is a fully managed service that offers a choice of high-performing foundation models (FMs) from leading AI companies like `AI21 Labs`, `Anthropic`, `Cohere`, `Meta`, `Stability AI`, and `Amazon` via a single API, along with a broad set of capabilities you need to build generative AI applications with security, privacy, and responsible AI. Using `Amazon Bedrock`, you can easily experiment with and evaluate top FMs for your use case, privately customize them with your data using techniques such as fine-tuning and `Retrieval Augmented Generation` (`RAG`), and build agents that execute tasks using your enterprise systems and data sources. Since `Amazon Bedrock` is serverless, you don't have to manage any infrastructure, and you can securely integrate and deploy generative AI capabilities into your applications using the AWS services you are already familiar with.

See a [usage example](/oss/integrations/chat/bedrock).

```
from langchain_aws import ChatBedrock
```

**API Reference:**[ChatBedrock](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/aws/chat_models/langchain_aws.chat_models.bedrock.ChatBedrock.html)

### Bedrock Converse

AWS Bedrock maintains a [Converse API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/APIReference/API_runtime_Converse.html) that provides a unified conversational interface for Bedrock models.
