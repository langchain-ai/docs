This page covers how to use [LanceDB](https://github.com/lancedb/lancedb) within LangChain. It is broken into two parts: installation and setup, and then references to specific LanceDB wrappers.

## Installation and Setup

* Install the Python SDK with `pip install lancedb`

## Wrappers

### VectorStore

There exists a wrapper around LanceDB databases, allowing you to use it as a vectorstore, whether for semantic search or example selection.

To import this vectorstore:

```
from langchain_community.vectorstores import LanceDB
```

**API Reference:**[LanceDB](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/community/vectorstores/langchain_community.vectorstores.lancedb.LanceDB.html)

For a more detailed walkthrough of the LanceDB wrapper, see [this notebook](/oss/integrations/vectorstores/lancedb)
