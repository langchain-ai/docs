## Installation and Setup

```
pip install cnos-connector
```

## Connecting to CnosDB

You can connect to CnosDB using the `SQLDatabase.from_cnosdb()` method.

### Syntax

```
def SQLDatabase.from_cnosdb(url: str = "127.0.0.1:8902",                              user: str = "root",                              password: str = "",                              tenant: str = "cnosdb",                              database: str = "public")
```

Args:

1. url (str): The HTTP connection host name and port number of the CnosDB service, excluding "http\://" or "https\://", with a default value of "127.0.0.1:8902".
2. user (str): The username used to connect to the CnosDB service, with a default value of "root".
3. password (str): The password of the user connecting to the CnosDB service, with a default value of "".
4. tenant (str): The name of the tenant used to connect to the CnosDB service, with a default value of "cnosdb".
5. database (str): The name of the database in the CnosDB tenant.

### SQL Database Chain

This example demonstrates the use of the SQL Chain for answering a question over a CnosDB.

```
from langchain_community.utilities import SQLDatabaseChaindb_chain = SQLDatabaseChain.from_llm(llm, db, verbose=True)db_chain.run(    "What is the average temperature of air at station XiaoMaiDao between October 19, 2022 and Occtober 20, 2022?")
```

```
> Entering new  chain...What is the average temperature of air at station XiaoMaiDao between October 19, 2022 and Occtober 20, 2022?SQLQuery:SELECT AVG(temperature) FROM air WHERE station = 'XiaoMaiDao' AND time >= '2022-10-19' AND time < '2022-10-20'SQLResult: [(68.0,)]Answer:The average temperature of air at station XiaoMaiDao between October 19, 2022 and October 20, 2022 is 68.0.> Finished chain.
```

### SQL Database Agent

This example demonstrates the use of the SQL Database Agent for answering questions over a CnosDB.

```
from langchain.agents import create_sql_agentfrom langchain_community.agent_toolkits import SQLDatabaseToolkittoolkit = SQLDatabaseToolkit(db=db, llm=llm)agent = create_sql_agent(llm=llm, toolkit=toolkit, verbose=True)
```

**API Reference:**[create\_sql\_agent](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/community/agent_toolkits/langchain_community.agent_toolkits.sql.base.create_sql_agent.html) | [SQLDatabaseToolkit](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/community/agent_toolkits/langchain_community.agent_toolkits.sql.toolkit.SQLDatabaseToolkit.html)

```
agent.run(    "What is the average temperature of air at station XiaoMaiDao between October 19, 2022 and Occtober 20, 2022?")
```

```
