> [Xata](https://xata.io) is a serverless data platform, based on `PostgreSQL`. It provides a Python SDK for interacting with your database, and a UI for managing your data. `Xata` has a native vector type, which can be added to any table, and supports similarity search. LangChain inserts vectors directly to `Xata`, and queries it for the nearest neighbors of a given vector, so that you can use all the LangChain Embeddings integrations with `Xata`.

## Installation and Setup

We need to install `xata` python package.

```
pip install xata==1.0.0a7 
```

## Vector Store

See a [usage example](/oss/integrations/vectorstores/xata).

```
from langchain_community.vectorstores import XataVectorStore
```

## Memory

See a [usage example](/oss/integrations/memory/xata_chat_message_history).

```
from langchain_community.chat_message_histories import XataChatMessageHistory
```
