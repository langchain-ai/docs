Cognee implements scalable, modular ECL (Extract, Cognify, Load) pipelines that allow you to interconnect and retrieve past conversations, documents, and audio transcriptions while reducing hallucinations, developer effort, and cost.

Cognee merges graph and vector databases to uncover hidden relationships and new patterns in your data. You can automatically model, load and retrieve entities and objects representing your business domain and analyze their relationships, uncovering insights that neither vector stores nor graph stores alone can provide.
