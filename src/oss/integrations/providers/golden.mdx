> [Golden](https://golden.com) provides a set of natural language APIs for querying and enrichment using the Golden Knowledge Graph e.g. queries such as: `Products from OpenAI`, `Generative ai companies with series a funding`, and `rappers who invest` can be used to retrieve structured data about relevant entities.
>
> The `golden-query` langchain tool is a wrapper on top of the [Golden Query API](https://docs.golden.com/reference/query-api) which enables programmatic access to these results. See the [Golden Query API docs](https://docs.golden.com/reference/query-api) for more information.

## Installation and Setup

* Go to the [Golden API docs](https://docs.golden.com/) to get an overview about the Golden API.
* Get your API key from the [Golden API Settings](https://golden.com/settings/api) page.
* Save your API key into GOLDEN\_API\_KEY env variable

## Wrappers

### Utility

There exists a GoldenQueryAPIWrapper utility which wraps this API. To import this utility:

```
from langchain_community.utilities.golden_query import GoldenQueryAPIWrapper
```

**API Reference:**[GoldenQueryAPIWrapper](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/community/utilities/langchain_community.utilities.golden_query.GoldenQueryAPIWrapper.html)

For a more detailed walkthrough of this wrapper, see [this notebook](/src/oss/integrations/tools/golden_query).

### Tool

You can also easily load this wrapper as a Tool (to use with an Agent). You can do this with:

```
from langchain_community.agent_toolkits.load_tools import load_toolstools = load_tools(["golden-query"])
```

**API Reference:**[load\_tools](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/community/agent_toolkits/langchain_community.agent_toolkits.load_tools.load_tools.html)
