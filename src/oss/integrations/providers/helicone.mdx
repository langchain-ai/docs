This page covers how to use the [Helicone](https://helicone.ai) ecosystem within LangChain.

## What is Helicone?

Helicone is an [open-source](https://github.com/Helicone/helicone) observability platform that proxies your OpenAI traffic and provides you key insights into your spend, latency and usage.

## Quick start

With your LangChain environment you can just add the following parameter.

```
export OPENAI_API_BASE="https://oai.hconeai.com/v1"
```

Now head over to [helicone.ai](https://www.helicone.ai/signup) to create your account, and add your OpenAI API key within our dashboard to view your logs.

## How to enable Helicone caching

```
from langchain_openai import OpenAIimport openaiopenai.api_base = "https://oai.hconeai.com/v1"llm = OpenAI(temperature=0.9, headers={"Helicone-Cache-Enabled": "true"})text = "What is a helicone?"print(llm.invoke(text))
```

**API Reference:**[OpenAI](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/openai/llms/langchain_openai.llms.base.OpenAI.html)

## How to use Helicone custom properties

```
from langchain_openai import OpenAIimport openaiopenai.api_base = "https://oai.hconeai.com/v1"llm = OpenAI(temperature=0.9, headers={        "Helicone-Property-Session": "24",        "Helicone-Property-Conversation": "support_issue_2",        "Helicone-Property-App": "mobile",      })text = "What is a helicone?"print(llm.invoke(text))
```
