title: "Twitter (via Apify)"
---

This notebook shows how to load chat messages from Twitter to fine-tune on. We do this by utilizing Apify.

First, use Apify to export tweets. An example

```
import jsonfrom langchain_community.adapters.openai import convert_message_to_dictfrom langchain_core.messages import AIMessage
```

**API Reference:**[convert\_message\_to\_dict](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/community/adapters/langchain_community.adapters.openai.convert_message_to_dict.html) | [AIMessage](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/core/messages/langchain_core.messages.ai.AIMessage.html)

```
with open("example_data/dataset_twitter-scraper_2023-08-23_22-13-19-740.json") as f:    data = json.load(f)
```

```
# Filter out tweets that reference other tweets, because it's a bit weirdtweets = [d["full_text"] for d in data if "t.co" not in d["full_text"]]# Create them as AI messagesmessages = [AIMessage(content=t) for t in tweets]# Add in a system message at the start# TODO: we could try to extract the subject from the tweets, and put that in the system message.system_message = {"role": "system", "content": "write a tweet"}data = [[system_message, convert_message_to_dict(m)] for m in messages]
```
