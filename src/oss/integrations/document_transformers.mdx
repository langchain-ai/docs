  <Card title="📄️Doctran: interrogate documentsDocuments used in a vector store knowledge base are typically stored in a narrative or conversational format. However, most user queries are in question format. If we convert documents into Q&A format before vectorizing them, we can increase the likelihood of retrieving relevant documents, and decrease the likelihood of retrieving irrelevant documents." href="/oss/integrations/document_transformers/doctran_interrogate_document/">

  <Card title="📄️Google Cloud Vertex AI RerankerThe Vertex Search Ranking API is one of the standalone APIs in Vertex AI Agent Builder. It takes a list of documents and reranks those documents based on how relevant the documents are to a query. Compared to embeddings, which look only at the semantic similarity of a document and a query, the ranking API can give you precise scores for how well a document answers a given query. The ranking API can be used to improve the quality of search results after retrieving an initial set of candidate documents." href="/oss/integrations/document_transformers/google_cloud_vertexai_rerank/">
