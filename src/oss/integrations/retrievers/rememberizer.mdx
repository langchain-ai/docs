> [Rememberizer](https://rememberizer.ai/) is a knowledge enhancement service for AI applications created by SkyDeck AI Inc.

This notebook shows how to retrieve documents from `Rememberizer` into the Document format that is used downstream.

# Preparation

You will need an API key: you can get one after creating a common knowledge at [https://rememberizer.ai](https://rememberizer.ai/). Once you have an API key, you must set it as an environment variable `REMEMBERIZER_API_KEY` or pass it as `rememberizer_api_key` when initializing `RememberizerRetriever`.

`RememberizerRetriever` has these arguments:

* optional `top_k_results`: default=10. Use it to limit number of returned documents.
* optional `rememberizer_api_key`: required if you don't set the environment variable `REMEMBERIZER_API_KEY`.

`get_relevant_documents()` has one argument, `query`: free text which used to find documents in the common knowledge of `Rememberizer.ai`

# Examples

## Basic usage

```
# Setup API keyfrom getpass import getpassREMEMBERIZER_API_KEY = getpass()
```

```
import osfrom langchain_community.retrievers import RememberizerRetrieveros.environ["REMEMBERIZER_API_KEY"] = REMEMBERIZER_API_KEYretriever = RememberizerRetriever(top_k_results=5)
```

**API Reference:**[RememberizerRetriever](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/community/retrievers/langchain_community.retrievers.rememberizer.RememberizerRetriever.html)

```
docs = retriever.get_relevant_documents(query="How does Large Language Models works?")
```

```
docs[0].metadata  # meta-information of the Document
```

```
{'id': 13646493, 'document_id': '17s3LlMbpkTk0ikvGwV0iLMCj-MNubIaP', 'name': 'What is a large language model (LLM)_ _ Cloudflare.pdf', 'type': 'application/pdf', 'path': '/langchain/What is a large language model (LLM)_ _ Cloudflare.pdf', 'url': 'https://drive.google.com/file/d/17s3LlMbpkTk0ikvGwV0iLMCj-MNubIaP/view', 'size': 337089, 'created_time': '', 'modified_time': '', 'indexed_on': '2024-04-04T03:36:28.886170Z', 'integration': {'id': 347, 'integration_type': 'google_drive'}}
```

```
print(docs[0].page_content[:400])  # a content of the Document
```

```
before, or contextualized in new ways. on some level they " understand " semantics in that they can associate words and concepts by their meaning, having seen them grouped together in that way millions or billions of times. how developers can quickly start building their own llms to build llm applications, developers need easy access to multiple data sets, and they need places for those data sets
```

# Usage in a chain

```
OPENAI_API_KEY = getpass()
```

```
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = OPENAI_API_KEY
```

```
from langchain.chains import ConversationalRetrievalChainfrom langchain_openai import ChatOpenAImodel = ChatOpenAI(model_name="gpt-3.5-turbo")qa = ConversationalRetrievalChain.from_llm(model, retriever=retriever)
```

**API Reference:**[ConversationalRetrievalChain](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/langchain/chains/langchain.chains.conversational_retrieval.base.ConversationalRetrievalChain.html) | [ChatOpenAI](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/openai/chat_models/langchain_openai.chat_models.base.ChatOpenAI.html)

```
questions = [    "What is RAG?",    "How does Large Language Models works?",]chat_history = []for question in questions:    result = qa.invoke({"question": question, "chat_history": chat_history})    chat_history.append((question, result["answer"]))    print(f"-> **Question**: {question} \n")    print(f"**Answer**: {result['answer']} \n")
```

```
-> **Question**: What is RAG? **Answer**: RAG stands for Retrieval-Augmented Generation. It is an AI framework that retrieves facts from an external knowledge base to enhance the responses generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) by providing up-to-date and accurate information. This framework helps users understand the generative process of LLMs and ensures that the model has access to reliable information sources. -> **Question**: How does Large Language Models works? **Answer**: Large Language Models (LLMs) work by analyzing massive data sets of language to comprehend and generate human language text. They are built on machine learning, specifically deep learning, which involves training a program to recognize features of data without human intervention. LLMs use neural networks, specifically transformer models, to understand context in human language, making them better at interpreting language even in vague or new contexts. Developers can quickly start building their own LLMs by accessing multiple data sets and using services like Cloudflare's Vectorize and Cloudflare Workers AI platform.
