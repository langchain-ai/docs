> [RAGatouille](https://github.com/bclavie/RAGatouille) makes it as simple as can be to use `ColBERT`!
>
> [ColBERT](https://github.com/stanford-futuredata/ColBERT) is a fast and accurate retrieval model, enabling scalable BERT-based search over large text collections in tens of milliseconds.
>
> See the [ColBERTv2: Effective and Efficient Retrieval via Lightweight Late Interaction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.01488) paper.

We can use this as a [retriever](/src/oss/how_to/#retrievers). It will show functionality specific to this integration. After going through, it may be useful to explore [relevant use-case pages](/src/oss/how_to/#qa-with-rag) to learn how to use this vector store as part of a larger chain.

This page covers how to use [RAGatouille](https://github.com/bclavie/RAGatouille) as a retriever in a LangChain chain.

## Setup

The integration lives in the `ragatouille` package.

```
pip install -U ragatouille
```

## Usage

This example is taken from their documentation

```
from ragatouille import RAGPretrainedModelRAG = RAGPretrainedModel.from_pretrained("colbert-ir/colbertv2.0")
```

```
import requestsdef get_wikipedia_page(title: str):    """    Retrieve the full text content of a Wikipedia page.    :param title: str - Title of the Wikipedia page.    :return: str - Full text content of the page as raw string.    """    # Wikipedia API endpoint    URL = "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php"    # Parameters for the API request    params = {        "action": "query",        "format": "json",        "titles": title,        "prop": "extracts",        "explaintext": True,    }    # Custom User-Agent header to comply with Wikipedia's best practices    headers = {"User-Agent": "RAGatouille_tutorial/0.0.1 (ben@clavie.eu)"}    response = requests.get(URL, params=params, headers=headers)    data = response.json()    # Extracting page content    page = next(iter(data["query"]["pages"].values()))    return page["extract"] if "extract" in page else None
```

```
full_document = get_wikipedia_page("Hayao_Miyazaki")
```

```
RAG.index(    collection=[full_document],    index_name="Miyazaki-123",    max_document_length=180,    split_documents=True,)
