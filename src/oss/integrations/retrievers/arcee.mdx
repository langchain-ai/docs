> [Arcee](https://www.arcee.ai/about/about-us) helps with the development of the SLMsâ€”small, specialized, secure, and scalable language models.

This notebook demonstrates how to use the `ArceeRetriever` class to retrieve relevant document(s) for Arcee's `Domain Adapted Language Models` (`DALMs`).

### Setup

Before using `ArceeRetriever`, make sure the Arcee API key is set as `ARCEE_API_KEY` environment variable. You can also pass the api key as a named parameter.

```
from langchain_community.retrievers import ArceeRetrieverretriever = ArceeRetriever(    model="DALM-PubMed",    # arcee_api_key="ARCEE-API-KEY" # if not already set in the environment)
```

**API Reference:**[ArceeRetriever](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/community/retrievers/langchain_community.retrievers.arcee.ArceeRetriever.html)

### Additional Configuration

You can also configure `ArceeRetriever`'s parameters such as `arcee_api_url`, `arcee_app_url`, and `model_kwargs` as needed. Setting the `model_kwargs` at the object initialization uses the filters and size as default for all the subsequent retrievals.

```
retriever = ArceeRetriever(    model="DALM-PubMed",    # arcee_api_key="ARCEE-API-KEY", # if not already set in the environment    arcee_api_url="https://custom-api.arcee.ai",  # default is https://api.arcee.ai    arcee_app_url="https://custom-app.arcee.ai",  # default is https://app.arcee.ai    model_kwargs={        "size": 5,        "filters": [            {                "field_name": "document",                "filter_type": "fuzzy_search",                "value": "Einstein",            }        ],    },)
```

### Retrieving documents

You can retrieve relevant documents from uploaded contexts by providing a query. Here's an example:

```
query = "Can AI-driven music therapy contribute to the rehabilitation of patients with disorders of consciousness?"documents = retriever.invoke(query)
```

### Additional parameters

Arcee allows you to apply `filters` and set the `size` (in terms of count) of retrieved document(s). Filters help narrow down the results. Here's how to use these parameters:

```
# Define filtersfilters = [    {"field_name": "document", "filter_type": "fuzzy_search", "value": "Music"},    {"field_name": "year", "filter_type": "strict_search", "value": "1905"},]# Retrieve documents with filters and size paramsdocuments = retriever.invoke(query, size=5, filters=filters)
```
