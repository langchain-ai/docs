title: "SEC filing"
---

> [SEC filing](https://www.sec.gov/edgar) is a financial statement or other formal document submitted to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Public companies, certain insiders, and broker-dealers are required to make regular `SEC filings`. Investors and financial professionals rely on these filings for information about companies they are evaluating for investment purposes.
>
> `SEC filings` data powered by [Kay.ai](https://kay.ai) and [Cybersyn](https://www.cybersyn.com/) via [Snowflake Marketplace](https://app.snowflake.com/marketplace/providers/GZTSZAS2KCS/Cybersyn%2C%20Inc).

## Setup

First, you will need to install the `kay` package. You will also need an API key: you can get one for free at [https://kay.ai](https://kay.ai/). Once you have an API key, you must set it as an environment variable `KAY_API_KEY`.

In this example, we're going to use the `KayAiRetriever`. Take a look at the [kay notebook](/src/oss/integrations/retrievers/kay) for more detailed information for the parameters that it accepts.\`

## Example

```
from langchain.chains import ConversationalRetrievalChainfrom langchain_community.retrievers import KayAiRetrieverfrom langchain_openai import ChatOpenAImodel = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-3.5-turbo")retriever = KayAiRetriever.create(    dataset_id="company", data_types=["10-K", "10-Q"], num_contexts=6)qa = ConversationalRetrievalChain.from_llm(model, retriever=retriever)
```
