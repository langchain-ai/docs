> WatsonxRerank is a wrapper for IBM [watsonx.ai](https://www.ibm.com/products/watsonx-ai) foundation models.

This notebook shows how to use [watsonx's rerank endpoint](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/watsonx-ai#text-rerank) in a retriever. This builds on top of ideas in the [ContextualCompressionRetriever](/src/oss/how_to/contextual_compression).

## Overview

## Setup

To access IBM watsonx.ai models you'll need to create an IBM watsonx.ai account, get an API key, and install the `langchain-ibm` integration package.

### Credentials

The cell below defines the credentials required to work with watsonx Foundation Model inferencing.

**Action:** Provide the IBM Cloud user API key. For details, see [Managing user API keys](https://cloud.ibm.com/oss/account?topic=account-userapikey\&interface=ui).

```
import osfrom getpass import getpasswatsonx_api_key = getpass()os.environ["WATSONX_APIKEY"] = watsonx_api_key
```

Additionally you are able to pass additional secrets as an environment variable.

```
import osos.environ["WATSONX_URL"] = "your service instance url"os.environ["WATSONX_TOKEN"] = "your token for accessing the CPD cluster"os.environ["WATSONX_PASSWORD"] = "your password for accessing the CPD cluster"os.environ["WATSONX_USERNAME"] = "your username for accessing the CPD cluster"os.environ["WATSONX_INSTANCE_ID"] = "your instance_id for accessing the CPD cluster"
```

### Installation

The LangChain IBM integration lives in the `langchain-ibm` package:

```
!pip install -qU langchain-ibm!pip install -qU langchain-community!pip install -qU langchain_text_splitters
```

For experiment purpose please also install `faiss` or `faiss-cpu` package:

```
!pip install --upgrade --quiet  faiss# OR  (depending on Python version)!pip install --upgrade --quiet  faiss-cpu
```

Helper function for printing docs

```
def pretty_print_docs(docs):    print(        f"\n{'-' * 100}\n".join(            [f"Document {i + 1}:\n\n" + d.page_content for i, d in enumerate(docs)]        )    )
```

## Instantiation

### Set up the base vector store retriever

Let's start by initializing a simple vector store retriever and storing the 2023 State of the Union speech (in chunks). We can set up the retriever to retrieve a high number (20) of docs.

Initialize the `WatsonxEmbeddings`. For more details see [WatsonxEmbeddings](/src/oss/integrations/text_embedding/ibm_watsonx).

**Note**:

* To provide context for the API call, you must add `project_id` or `space_id`. For more information see [documentation](https://www.ibm.com/oss/en/watsonx-as-a-service?topic=projects).
* Depending on the region of your provisioned service instance, use one of the urls described [here](https://ibm.github.io/watsonx-ai-python-sdk/setup_cloud.html#authentication).

In this example, we’ll use the `project_id` and Dallas url.

You need to specify `model_id` that will be used for embedding. All available models you can find in [documentation](https://ibm.github.io/watsonx-ai-python-sdk/fm_embeddings.html#EmbeddingModels).

```
from langchain_ibm import WatsonxEmbeddingswx_embeddings = WatsonxEmbeddings(    model_id="ibm/slate-125m-english-rtrvr",    url="https://us-south.ml.cloud.ibm.com",    project_id="PASTE YOUR PROJECT_ID HERE",)
```

## Usage

### Doing reranking with WatsonxRerank

Now let's wrap our base retriever with a `ContextualCompressionRetriever`. We'll add an `WatsonxRerank`, uses the watsonx rerank endpoint to rerank the returned results. Do note that it is mandatory to specify the model name in WatsonxRerank!

```
from langchain_ibm import WatsonxRerankwx_rerank = WatsonxRerank(    model_id="cross-encoder/ms-marco-minilm-l-12-v2",    url="https://us-south.ml.cloud.ibm.com",    project_id="PASTE YOUR PROJECT_ID HERE",)
```

**API Reference:**[WatsonxRerank](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/ibm/rerank/langchain_ibm.rerank.WatsonxRerank.html)

```
from langchain.retrievers.contextual_compression import ContextualCompressionRetrievercompression_retriever = ContextualCompressionRetriever(    base_compressor=wx_rerank, base_retriever=retriever)compressed_docs = compression_retriever.invoke(    "What did the president say about Ketanji Jackson Brown")pretty_print_docs(compressed_docs[:5])  # Printing the first 5 compressed documents
```

```

**API Reference:**[ChatWatsonx](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/ibm/chat_models/langchain_ibm.chat_models.ChatWatsonx.html)

```
from langchain.chains import RetrievalQAchain = RetrievalQA.from_chain_type(llm=wx_chat, retriever=compression_retriever)
```

**API Reference:**[RetrievalQA](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/langchain/chains/langchain.chains.retrieval_qa.base.RetrievalQA.html)

```
chain.invoke(query)
```

```
{'query': 'What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson', 'result': 'The President said that he had nominated Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson to serve on the United States Supreme Court, and described her as "one of our nation\'s top legal minds" who will continue Justice Breyer\'s legacy of excellence.'}
```
