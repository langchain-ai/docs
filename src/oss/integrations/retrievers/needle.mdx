## Needle Retriever

[Needle](https://needle-ai.com) makes it easy to create your RAG pipelines with minimal effort.

For more details, refer to our [API documentation](https://docs.needle-ai.com/oss/api-reference/needle-api)

## Overview

The Needle Document Loader is a utility for integrating Needle collections with LangChain. It enables seamless storage, retrieval, and utilization of documents for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) workflows.

This example demonstrates:

* Storing documents into a Needle collection.
* Setting up a retriever to fetch documents.
* Building a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline.

### Setup

Before starting, ensure you have the following environment variables set:

* NEEDLE\_API\_KEY: Your API key for authenticating with Needle.
* OPENAI\_API\_KEY: Your OpenAI API key for language model operations.

## Initialization

To initialize the NeedleLoader, you need the following parameters:

* needle\_api\_key: Your Needle API key (or set it as an environment variable).
* collection\_id: The ID of the Needle collection to work with.

```
import os
```

```
os.environ["NEEDLE_API_KEY"] = ""
```

```
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = ""
```

## Instantiation

```
from langchain_community.document_loaders.needle import NeedleLoadercollection_id = "clt_01J87M9T6B71DHZTHNXYZQRG5H"# Initialize NeedleLoader to store documents to the collectiondocument_loader = NeedleLoader(    needle_api_key=os.getenv("NEEDLE_API_KEY"),    collection_id=collection_id,)
```

**API Reference:**[NeedleLoader](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/community/document_loaders/langchain_community.document_loaders.needle.NeedleLoader.html)

## Load

To add files to the Needle collection:

```
files = {    "tech-radar-30.pdf": "https://www.thoughtworks.com/content/dam/thoughtworks/documents/radar/2024/04/tr_technology_radar_vol_30_en.pdf"}document_loader.add_files(files=files)
```

```
# Show the documents in the collection# collections_documents = document_loader.load()
```

## Usage

### Use within a chain

Below is a complete example of setting up a RAG pipeline with Needle within a chain:

```
