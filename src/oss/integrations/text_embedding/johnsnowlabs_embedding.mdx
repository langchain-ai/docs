> [John Snow Labs](https://nlp.johnsnowlabs.com/) NLP & LLM ecosystem includes software libraries for state-of-the-art AI at scale, Responsible AI, No-Code AI, and access to over 20,000 models for Healthcare, Legal, Finance, etc.
>
> Models are loaded with [nlp.load](https://nlp.johnsnowlabs.com/oss/en/jsl/load_api) and spark session is started >with [nlp.start()](https://nlp.johnsnowlabs.com/oss/en/jsl/start-a-sparksession) under the hood. For all 24.000+ models, see the [John Snow Labs Model Models Hub](https://nlp.johnsnowlabs.com/models)

## Setting up

```
%pip install --upgrade --quiet  johnsnowlabs
```

```
# If you have a enterprise license, you can run this to install enterprise features# from johnsnowlabs import nlp# nlp.install()
```

## Example

```
from langchain_community.embeddings.johnsnowlabs import JohnSnowLabsEmbeddings
```

**API Reference:**[JohnSnowLabsEmbeddings](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/community/embeddings/langchain_community.embeddings.johnsnowlabs.JohnSnowLabsEmbeddings.html)

Initialize Johnsnowlabs Embeddings and Spark Session

```
embedder = JohnSnowLabsEmbeddings("en.embed_sentence.biobert.clinical_base_cased")
```

Define some example texts . These could be any documents that you want to analyze - for example, news articles, social media posts, or product reviews.

```
texts = ["Cancer is caused by smoking", "Antibiotics aren't painkiller"]
```

Generate and print embeddings for the texts . The JohnSnowLabsEmbeddings class generates an embedding for each document, which is a numerical representation of the document's content. These embeddings can be used for various natural language processing tasks, such as document similarity comparison or text classification.

```
embeddings = embedder.embed_documents(texts)for i, embedding in enumerate(embeddings):    print(f"Embedding for document {i + 1}: {embedding}")
```

Generate and print an embedding for a single piece of text. You can also generate an embedding for a single piece of text, such as a search query. This can be useful for tasks like information retrieval, where you want to find documents that are similar to a given query.

```
query = "Cancer is caused by smoking"query_embedding = embedder.embed_query(query)print(f"Embedding for query: {query_embedding}")
```
