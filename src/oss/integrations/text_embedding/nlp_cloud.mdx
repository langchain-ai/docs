> [NLP Cloud](https://docs.nlpcloud.com/#introduction) is an artificial intelligence platform that allows you to use the most advanced AI engines, and even train your own engines with your own data.

The [embeddings](https://docs.nlpcloud.com/#embeddings) endpoint offers the following model:

* `paraphrase-multilingual-mpnet-base-v2`: Paraphrase Multilingual MPNet Base V2 is a very fast model based on Sentence Transformers that is perfectly suited for embeddings extraction in more than 50 languages (see the full list here).

```
%pip install --upgrade --quiet  nlpcloud
