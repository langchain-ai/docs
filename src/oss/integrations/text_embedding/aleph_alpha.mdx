There are two possible ways to use Aleph Alpha's semantic embeddings. If you have texts with a dissimilar structure (e.g. a Document and a Query) you would want to use asymmetric embeddings. Conversely, for texts with comparable structures, symmetric embeddings are the suggested approach.

## Asymmetric

```
from langchain_community.embeddings import AlephAlphaAsymmetricSemanticEmbedding
```

**API Reference:**[AlephAlphaAsymmetricSemanticEmbedding](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/community/embeddings/langchain_community.embeddings.aleph_alpha.AlephAlphaAsymmetricSemanticEmbedding.html)

```
document = "This is a content of the document"query = "What is the content of the document?"
```

```
embeddings = AlephAlphaAsymmetricSemanticEmbedding(normalize=True, compress_to_size=128)
```

```
doc_result = embeddings.embed_documents([document])
```

```
query_result = embeddings.embed_query(query)
```

## Symmetric

```
from langchain_community.embeddings import AlephAlphaSymmetricSemanticEmbedding
```

**API Reference:**[AlephAlphaSymmetricSemanticEmbedding](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/community/embeddings/langchain_community.embeddings.aleph_alpha.AlephAlphaSymmetricSemanticEmbedding.html)

```
text = "This is a test text"
```

```
embeddings = AlephAlphaSymmetricSemanticEmbedding(normalize=True, compress_to_size=128)
```

```
doc_result = embeddings.embed_documents([text])
```

```
query_result = embeddings.embed_query(text)
```
