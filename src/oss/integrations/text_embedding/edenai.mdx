This example goes over how to use LangChain to interact with Eden AI embedding models

***

Accessing the EDENAI's API requires an API key,

which you can get by creating an account [https://app.edenai.run/user/register](https://app.edenai.run/user/register) and heading here [https://app.edenai.run/admin/account/settings](https://app.edenai.run/admin/account/settings)

Once we have a key we'll want to set it as an environment variable by running:

```
export EDENAI_API_KEY="..."
```

If you'd prefer not to set an environment variable you can pass the key in directly via the edenai\_api\_key named parameter

when initiating the EdenAI embedding class:

```
from langchain_community.embeddings.edenai import EdenAiEmbeddings
```

**API Reference:**[EdenAiEmbeddings](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/community/embeddings/langchain_community.embeddings.edenai.EdenAiEmbeddings.html)

```
embeddings = EdenAiEmbeddings(edenai_api_key="...", provider="...")
```

## Calling a model

The EdenAI API brings together various providers.

To access a specific model, you can simply use the "provider" when calling.

```
embeddings = EdenAiEmbeddings(provider="openai")
```

```
docs = ["It's raining right now", "cats are cute"]document_result = embeddings.embed_documents(docs)
```

```
query = "my umbrella is broken"query_result = embeddings.embed_query(query)
```

```
import numpy as npquery_numpy = np.array(query_result)for doc_res, doc in zip(document_result, docs):    document_numpy = np.array(doc_res)    similarity = np.dot(query_numpy, document_numpy) / (        np.linalg.norm(query_numpy) * np.linalg.norm(document_numpy)    )    print(f'Cosine similarity between "{doc}" and query: {similarity}')
```

```
Cosine similarity between "It's raining right now" and query: 0.849261496107252Cosine similarity between "cats are cute" and query: 0.7525900655705218
```
