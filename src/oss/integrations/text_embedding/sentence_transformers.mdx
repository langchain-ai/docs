title: "Sentence Transformers on Hugging Face"
---

> [Hugging Face sentence-transformers](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers) is a Python framework for state-of-the-art sentence, text and image embeddings. You can use these embedding models from the `HuggingFaceEmbeddings` class.

<Warning>
  Running sentence-transformers locally can be affected by your operating system and other global factors. It is recommended for experienced users only.
</Warning>

## Setup

You'll need to install the `langchain_huggingface` package as a dependency:

```
%pip install -qU langchain-huggingface
```

## Usage

```
from langchain_huggingface import HuggingFaceEmbeddingsembeddings = HuggingFaceEmbeddings(model_name="all-MiniLM-L6-v2")text = "This is a test document."query_result = embeddings.embed_query(text)# show only the first 100 characters of the stringified vectorprint(str(query_result)[:100] + "...")
```

## Troubleshooting

If you are having issues with the `accelerate` package not being found or failing to import, installing/upgrading it may help:

```
%pip install -qU accelerate
```
