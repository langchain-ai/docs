> [TensorFlow Hub](https://www.tensorflow.org/hub) is a repository of trained machine learning models ready for fine-tuning and deployable anywhere. Reuse trained models like `BERT` and `Faster R-CNN` with just a few lines of code.

Let's load the TensorflowHub Embedding class.

```
from langchain_community.embeddings import TensorflowHubEmbeddings
```

**API Reference:**[TensorflowHubEmbeddings](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/community/embeddings/langchain_community.embeddings.tensorflow_hub.TensorflowHubEmbeddings.html)

```
embeddings = TensorflowHubEmbeddings()
```

```

```

```
text = "This is a test document."
```

```
query_result = embeddings.embed_query(text)
```

```
doc_results = embeddings.embed_documents(["foo"])
```

```
doc_results
```
