> [Amazon Bedrock](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/) is a fully managed service that offers a choice of high-performing foundation models (FMs) from leading AI companies like `AI21 Labs`, `Anthropic`, `Cohere`, `Meta`, `Stability AI`, and `Amazon` via a single API, along with a broad set of capabilities you need to build generative AI applications with security, privacy, and responsible AI. Using `Amazon Bedrock`, you can easily experiment with and evaluate top FMs for your use case, privately customize them with your data using techniques such as fine-tuning and `Retrieval Augmented Generation` (`RAG`), and build agents that execute tasks using your enterprise systems and data sources. Since `Amazon Bedrock` is serverless, you don't have to manage any infrastructure, and you can securely integrate and deploy generative AI capabilities into your applications using the AWS services you are already familiar with.
