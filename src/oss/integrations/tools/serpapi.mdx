```
from langchain_community.utilities import SerpAPIWrapper
```

**API Reference:**[SerpAPIWrapper](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/community/utilities/langchain_community.utilities.serpapi.SerpAPIWrapper.html)

```
search = SerpAPIWrapper()

search.run("Obama's first name?")

params = {    "engine": "bing",    "gl": "us",    "hl": "en",}search = SerpAPIWrapper(params=params)
