```

## Usage

Initialize `UpstageGroundednessCheck` class.

```
from langchain_upstage import UpstageGroundednessCheckgroundedness_check = UpstageGroundednessCheck()
```

**API Reference:**[UpstageGroundednessCheck](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/upstage/tools/langchain_upstage.tools.groundedness_check.UpstageGroundednessCheck.html)

Use the `run` method to check the groundedness of the input text.

Its peak is 4,207.3 m above sea level, making it the highest point in Hawaii and second-highest peak of an island on Earth.",    "answer": "Mauna Kea is 5,207.3 meters tall.",}response = groundedness_check.invoke(request_input)print(response)
```
