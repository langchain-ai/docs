> [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) is a query language for APIs and a runtime for executing those queries against your data. `GraphQL` provides a complete and understandable description of the data in your API, gives clients the power to ask for exactly what they need and nothing more, makes it easier to evolve APIs over time, and enables powerful developer tools.

By including a `BaseGraphQLTool` in the list of tools provided to an Agent, you can grant your Agent the ability to query data from GraphQL APIs for any purposes you need.

This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates how to use the `GraphQLAPIWrapper` component with an Agent.

In this example, we'll be using the public `Star Wars GraphQL API` available at the following endpoint: [https://swapi-graphql.netlify.app/graphql](https://swapi-graphql.netlify.app/graphql) .

First, you need to install `httpx` and `gql` Python packages.

```
pip install httpx gql > /dev/null
```

```
Note: you may need to restart the kernel to use updated packages.
```

```
%pip install --upgrade --quiet  langchain-community
```

```
Note: you may need to restart the kernel to use updated packages.
```

Now, let's create a BaseGraphQLTool instance with the specified Star Wars API endpoint and initialize an Agent with the tool.

```
import osos.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = ""
```

```
from langchain_community.agent_toolkits.load_tools import load_toolstools = load_tools(    ["graphql"],    graphql_endpoint="https://swapi-graphql.netlify.app/graphql",)
```

**API Reference:**[load\_tools](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/community/agent_toolkits/langchain_community.agent_toolkits.load_tools.load_tools.html)

```
from langgraph.prebuilt import create_react_agentagent = create_react_agent("openai:gpt-4.1-mini", tools)
```

**API Reference:**[create\_react\_agent](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/reference/prebuilt/#langgraph.prebuilt.chat_agent_executor.create_react_agent)

Now, we can use the Agent to run queries against the Star Wars GraphQL API. Let's ask the Agent to list all the Star Wars films and their release dates.

```
graphql_fields = """allFilms {    films {      title      director      releaseDate      speciesConnection {        species {          name          classification          homeworld {            name          }        }      }    }  }"""suffix = "Search for the titles of all the stawars films stored in the graphql database that has this schema "input_message = {    "role": "user",    "content": suffix + graphql_fields,}for step in agent.stream(    {"messages": [input_message]},    stream_mode="values",):    step["messages"][-1].pretty_print()
```

```
