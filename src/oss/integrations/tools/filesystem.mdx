title: "File System"
---

LangChain provides tools for interacting with a local file system out of the box. This notebook walks through some of them.

**Note:** these tools are not recommended for use outside a sandboxed environment!

```
%pip install -qU langchain-community
```

First, we'll import the tools.

```
from tempfile import TemporaryDirectoryfrom langchain_community.agent_toolkits import FileManagementToolkit# We'll make a temporary directory to avoid clutterworking_directory = TemporaryDirectory()
```

**API Reference:**[FileManagementToolkit](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/community/agent_toolkits/langchain_community.agent_toolkits.file_management.toolkit.FileManagementToolkit.html)

## The FileManagementToolkit

If you want to provide all the file tooling to your agent, it's easy to do so with the toolkit. We'll pass the temporary directory in as a root directory as a workspace for the LLM.

It's recommended to always pass in a root directory, since without one, it's easy for the LLM to pollute the working directory, and without one, there isn't any validation against straightforward prompt injection.

```
toolkit = FileManagementToolkit(    root_dir=str(working_directory.name))  # If you don't provide a root_dir, operations will default to the current working directorytoolkit.get_tools()
```

```
[CopyFileTool(root_dir='/tmp/tmprdvsw3tg'), DeleteFileTool(root_dir='/tmp/tmprdvsw3tg'), FileSearchTool(root_dir='/tmp/tmprdvsw3tg'), MoveFileTool(root_dir='/tmp/tmprdvsw3tg'), ReadFileTool(root_dir='/tmp/tmprdvsw3tg'), WriteFileTool(root_dir='/tmp/tmprdvsw3tg'), ListDirectoryTool(root_dir='/tmp/tmprdvsw3tg')]
```

### Selecting File System Tools

If you only want to select certain tools, you can pass them in as arguments when initializing the toolkit, or you can individually initialize the desired tools.

```
tools = FileManagementToolkit(    root_dir=str(working_directory.name),    selected_tools=["read_file", "write_file", "list_directory"],).get_tools()tools
```

```
[ReadFileTool(root_dir='/tmp/tmprdvsw3tg'), WriteFileTool(root_dir='/tmp/tmprdvsw3tg'), ListDirectoryTool(root_dir='/tmp/tmprdvsw3tg')]
```

```
read_tool, write_tool, list_tool = toolswrite_tool.invoke({"file_path": "example.txt", "text": "Hello World!"})
```

```
'File written successfully to example.txt.'
```

```
# List files in the working directorylist_tool.invoke({})
```

```
'example.txt'
```
