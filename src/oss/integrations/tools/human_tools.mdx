Human are AGI so they can certainly be used as a tool to help out AI agent when it is confused.

```
%pip install --upgrade --quiet  langchain-community
```

```
from langchain.agents import AgentType, initialize_agent, load_toolsfrom langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI, OpenAIllm = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0.0)math_llm = OpenAI(temperature=0.0)tools = load_tools(    ["human", "llm-math"],    llm=math_llm,)agent_chain = initialize_agent(    tools,    llm,    agent=AgentType.ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION,    verbose=True,)
```

**API Reference:**[AgentType](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/langchain/agents/langchain.agents.agent_types.AgentType.html) | [initialize\_agent](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/langchain/agents/langchain.agents.initialize.initialize_agent.html) | [load\_tools](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/community/agent_toolkits/langchain_community.agent_toolkits.load_tools.load_tools.html) | [ChatOpenAI](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/openai/chat_models/langchain_openai.chat_models.base.ChatOpenAI.html) | [OpenAI](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/openai/llms/langchain_openai.llms.base.OpenAI.html)

In the above code you can see the tool takes input directly from command line. You can customize `prompt_func` and `input_func` according to your need (as shown below).

```
agent_chain.run("What's my friend Eric's surname?")# Answer with 'Zhu'
```

```````

```
"Eric's surname is Zhu."
```

## Configuring the Input Function

By default, the `HumanInputRun` tool uses the python `input` function to get input from the user. You can customize the input\_func to be anything you'd like. For instance, if you want to accept multi-line input, you could do the following:

```
def get_input() -> str:    print("Insert your text. Enter 'q' or press Ctrl-D (or Ctrl-Z on Windows) to end.")    contents = []    while True:        try:            line = input()        except EOFError:            break        if line == "q":            break        contents.append(line)    return "\n".join(contents)# You can modify the tool when loadingtools = load_tools(["human", "ddg-search"], llm=math_llm, input_func=get_input)
```

```
# Or you can directly instantiate the toolfrom langchain_community.tools import HumanInputRuntool = HumanInputRun(input_func=get_input)
```
