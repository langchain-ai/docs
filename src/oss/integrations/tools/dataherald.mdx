This notebook goes over how to use the dataherald component.

First, you need to set up your Dataherald account and get your API KEY:

1. Go to dataherald and sign up [here](https://www.dataherald.com/)
2. Once you are logged in your Admin Console, create an API KEY
3. pip install dataherald

Then we will need to set some environment variables:

1. Save your API KEY into DATAHERALD\_API\_KEY env variable

```
pip install dataherald%pip install --upgrade --quiet langchain-community
```

```
import osos.environ["DATAHERALD_API_KEY"] = ""
```

```
from langchain_community.utilities.dataherald import DataheraldAPIWrapper
```

**API Reference:**[DataheraldAPIWrapper](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/community/utilities/langchain_community.utilities.dataherald.DataheraldAPIWrapper.html)

```
dataherald = DataheraldAPIWrapper(db_connection_id="65fb766367dd22c99ce1a12d")
```

```
dataherald.run("How many employees are in the company?")
```

```
'select COUNT(*) from employees'
```
