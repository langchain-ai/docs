This notebook goes over how to use the Google Jobs Tool to fetch current Job postings.

First, you need to sign up for an `SerpApi key` key at: [https://serpapi.com/users/sign\_up](https://serpapi.com/users/sign_up) and get your api key here: [https://serpapi.com/manage-api-key](https://serpapi.com/manage-api-key).

Then you must install `google-search-results` with the command: `pip install google-search-results`

Then you will need to set the environment variable `SERPAPI_API_KEY` to your `SerpApi key`

If you are using conda environment, you can set up using the following commands in kernal: conda activate \[your env name] conda env confiv vars SERPAPI\_API\_KEY='\[your serp api key]'

## Use the Tool

```
%pip install --upgrade --quiet google-search-results langchain-community
```

```
Note: you may need to restart the kernel to use updated packages.
```

```
import osos.environ["SERPAPI_API_KEY"] = ""
```

```
