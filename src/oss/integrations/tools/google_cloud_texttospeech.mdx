> [Google Cloud Text-to-Speech](https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech) enables developers to synthesize natural-sounding speech with 100+ voices, available in multiple languages and variants. It applies DeepMind’s groundbreaking research in WaveNet and Google’s powerful neural networks to deliver the highest fidelity possible.
>
> It supports multiple languages, including English, German, Polish, Spanish, Italian, French, Portuguese, and Hindi.

This notebook shows how to interact with the `Google Cloud Text-to-Speech API` to achieve speech synthesis capabilities.

First, you need to set up an Google Cloud project. You can follow the instructions [here](https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech/oss/before-you-begin).

```
!pip install --upgrade langchain-google-community[texttospeech]
```

## Instantiation

```
from langchain_google_community import TextToSpeechTool
```

**API Reference:**[TextToSpeechTool](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/google_community/texttospeech/langchain_google_community.texttospeech.TextToSpeechTool.html)

## Deprecated GoogleCloudTextToSpeechTool

```
from langchain_community.tools import GoogleCloudTextToSpeechTool
```

**API Reference:**[GoogleCloudTextToSpeechTool](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/community/tools/langchain_community.tools.google_cloud.texttospeech.GoogleCloudTextToSpeechTool.html)

```
text_to_speak = "Hello world!"tts = GoogleCloudTextToSpeechTool()tts.name
```

We can generate audio, save it to the temporary file and then play it.

```
speech_file = tts.run(text_to_speak)
```
