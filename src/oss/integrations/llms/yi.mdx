[01.AI](https://www.lingyiwanwu.com/en), founded by Dr. Kai-Fu Lee, is a global company at the forefront of AI 2.0. They offer cutting-edge large language models, including the Yi series, which range from 6B to hundreds of billions of parameters. 01.AI also provides multimodal models, an open API platform, and open-source options like Yi-34B/9B/6B and Yi-VL.

```
## Installing the langchain packages needed to use the integration%pip install -qU langchain-community
```

## Prerequisite

An API key is required to access Yi LLM API. Visit [https://www.lingyiwanwu.com/](https://www.lingyiwanwu.com/) to get your API key. When applying for the API key, you need to specify whether it's for domestic (China) or international use.

## Use Yi LLM

```
import osos.environ["YI_API_KEY"] = "YOUR_API_KEY"from langchain_community.llms import YiLLM# Load the modelllm = YiLLM(model="yi-large")# You can specify the region if needed (default is "auto")# llm = YiLLM(model="yi-large", region="domestic")  # or "international"# Basic usageres = llm.invoke("What's your name?")print(res)
```

**API Reference:**[YiLLM](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/community/llms/langchain_community.llms.yi.YiLLM.html)

```
# Generate methodres = llm.generate(    prompts=[        "Explain the concept of large language models.",        "What are the potential applications of AI in healthcare?",    ])print(res)
```

```
# Streamingfor chunk in llm.stream("Describe the key features of the Yi language model series."):    print(chunk, end="", flush=True)
```

```
# Asynchronous streamingimport asyncioasync def run_aio_stream():    async for chunk in llm.astream(        "Write a brief on the future of AI according to Dr. Kai-Fu Lee's vision."    ):        print(chunk, end="", flush=True)asyncio.run(run_aio_stream())
```

```
# Adjusting parametersllm_with_params = YiLLM(    model="yi-large",    temperature=0.7,    top_p=0.9,)res = llm_with_params(    "Propose an innovative AI application that could benefit society.")print(res)
```
