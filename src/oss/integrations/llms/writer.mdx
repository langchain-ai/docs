[Writer](https://writer.com/) is a platform to generate different language content.

This example goes over how to use LangChain to interact with `Writer` [models](https://dev.writer.com/oss/models).

## Setup

To access Writer models you'll need to create a Writer account, get an API key, and install the `writer-sdk` and `langchain-community` packages.

### Credentials

Head to [Writer AI Studio](https://app.writer.com/aistudio/signup?utm_campaign=devrel) to sign up to OpenAI and generate an API key. Once you've done this set the WRITER\_API\_KEY environment variable:

```
import getpassimport osif not os.environ.get("WRITER_API_KEY"):    os.environ["WRITER_API_KEY"] = getpass.getpass("Enter your Writer API key:")
```

## Installation

The LangChain Writer integration lives in the `langchain-community` package:

```
%pip install -qU langchain-community writer-sdk
```

```
[1m[[0m[34;49mnotice[0m[1;39;49m][0m[39;49m A new release of pip is available: [0m[31;49m24.2[0m[39;49m -> [0m[32;49m24.3.1[0m[1m[[0m[34;49mnotice[0m[1;39;49m][0m[39;49m To update, run: [0m[32;49mpip install --upgrade pip[0mNote: you may need to restart the kernel to use updated packages.
```

Now we can initialize our model object to interact with writer LLMs

```
from langchain_community.llms import Writer as WriterLLMllm = WriterLLM(    temperature=0.7,    max_tokens=1000,    # other params...)
```

**API Reference:**[Writer](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/community/llms/langchain_community.llms.writer.Writer.html)

## Invocation

```
response_text = llm.invoke(input="Write a poem")
```

```
print(response_text)
```

## Streaming

```
stream_response = llm.stream(input="Tell me a fairytale")
```

```
for chunk in stream_response:    print(chunk, end="")
```

## Async

Writer support asynchronous calls via **ainvoke()** and **astream()** methods
