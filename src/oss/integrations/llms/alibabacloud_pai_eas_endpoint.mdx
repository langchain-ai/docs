##Installing the langchain packages needed to use the integration%pip install -qU langchain-community
```

```
from langchain.chains import LLMChainfrom langchain_community.llms.pai_eas_endpoint import PaiEasEndpointfrom langchain_core.prompts import PromptTemplatetemplate = """Question: {question}Answer: Let's think step by step."""prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template(template)
```

**API Reference:**[LLMChain](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/langchain/chains/langchain.chains.llm.LLMChain.html) | [PaiEasEndpoint](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/community/llms/langchain_community.llms.pai_eas_endpoint.PaiEasEndpoint.html) | [PromptTemplate](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/core/prompts/langchain_core.prompts.prompt.PromptTemplate.html)

One who wants to use EAS LLMs must set up EAS service first. When the EAS service is launched, `EAS_SERVICE_URL` and `EAS_SERVICE_TOKEN` can be obtained. Users can refer to [https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/en/pai/user-guide/service-deployment/](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/en/pai/user-guide/service-deployment/) for more information,

```
import osos.environ["EAS_SERVICE_URL"] = "Your_EAS_Service_URL"os.environ["EAS_SERVICE_TOKEN"] = "Your_EAS_Service_Token"llm = PaiEasEndpoint(    eas_service_url=os.environ["EAS_SERVICE_URL"],    eas_service_token=os.environ["EAS_SERVICE_TOKEN"],)
```

```
llm_chain = prompt | llmquestion = "What NFL team won the Super Bowl in the year Justin Beiber was born?"llm_chain.invoke({"question": question})
```

```
'  Thank you for asking! However, I must respectfully point out that the question contains an error. Justin Bieber was born in 1994, and the Super Bowl was first played in 1967. Therefore, it is not possible for any NFL team to have won the Super Bowl in the year Justin Bieber was born.\n\nI hope this clarifies things! If you have any other questions, please feel free to ask.'
