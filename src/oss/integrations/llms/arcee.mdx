This notebook demonstrates how to use the `Arcee` class for generating text using Arcee's Domain Adapted Language Models (DALMs).

```
##Installing the langchain packages needed to use the integration%pip install -qU langchain-community
```

### Setup

Before using Arcee, make sure the Arcee API key is set as `ARCEE_API_KEY` environment variable. You can also pass the api key as a named parameter.

```
from langchain_community.llms import Arcee# Create an instance of the Arcee classarcee = Arcee(    model="DALM-PubMed",    # arcee_api_key="ARCEE-API-KEY" # if not already set in the environment)
```

**API Reference:**[Arcee](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/community/llms/langchain_community.llms.arcee.Arcee.html)

### Additional Configuration

You can also configure Arcee's parameters such as `arcee_api_url`, `arcee_app_url`, and `model_kwargs` as needed. Setting the `model_kwargs` at the object initialization uses the parameters as default for all the subsequent calls to the generate response.

```
arcee = Arcee(    model="DALM-Patent",    # arcee_api_key="ARCEE-API-KEY", # if not already set in the environment    arcee_api_url="https://custom-api.arcee.ai",  # default is https://api.arcee.ai    arcee_app_url="https://custom-app.arcee.ai",  # default is https://app.arcee.ai    model_kwargs={        "size": 5,        "filters": [            {                "field_name": "document",                "filter_type": "fuzzy_search",                "value": "Einstein",            }        ],    },)
```

### Generating Text

You can generate text from Arcee by providing a prompt. Here's an example:

```
# Generate textprompt = "Can AI-driven music therapy contribute to the rehabilitation of patients with disorders of consciousness?"response = arcee(prompt)
```

### Additional parameters

Arcee allows you to apply `filters` and set the `size` (in terms of count) of retrieved document(s) to aid text generation. Filters help narrow down the results. Here's how to use these parameters:

```
# Define filtersfilters = [    {"field_name": "document", "filter_type": "fuzzy_search", "value": "Einstein"},    {"field_name": "year", "filter_type": "strict_search", "value": "1905"},]# Generate text with filters and size paramsresponse = arcee(prompt, size=5, filters=filters)
```
