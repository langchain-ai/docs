[OpenLM](https://github.com/r2d4/openlm) is a zero-dependency OpenAI-compatible LLM provider that can call different inference endpoints directly via HTTP.

It implements the OpenAI Completion class so that it can be used as a drop-in replacement for the OpenAI API. This changeset utilizes BaseOpenAI for minimal added code.

This examples goes over how to use LangChain to interact with both OpenAI and HuggingFace. You'll need API keys from both.

### Setup

Install dependencies and set API keys.

```
# Uncomment to install openlm and openai if you haven't already%pip install --upgrade --quiet  openlm%pip install --upgrade --quiet  langchain-openai
```

```
import osfrom getpass import getpass# Check if OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable is setif "OPENAI_API_KEY" not in os.environ:    print("Enter your OpenAI API key:")    os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = getpass()# Check if HF_API_TOKEN environment variable is setif "HF_API_TOKEN" not in os.environ:    print("Enter your HuggingFace Hub API key:")    os.environ["HF_API_TOKEN"] = getpass()
```

### Using LangChain with OpenLM

Here we're going to call two models in an LLMChain, `text-davinci-003` from OpenAI and `gpt2` on HuggingFace.

```
from langchain.chains import LLMChainfrom langchain_community.llms import OpenLMfrom langchain_core.prompts import PromptTemplate
```

**API Reference:**[LLMChain](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/langchain/chains/langchain.chains.llm.LLMChain.html) | [OpenLM](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/community/llms/langchain_community.llms.openlm.OpenLM.html) | [PromptTemplate](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/core/prompts/langchain_core.prompts.prompt.PromptTemplate.html)

```
question = "What is the capital of France?"template = """Question: {question}Answer: Let's think step by step."""prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template(template)for model in ["text-davinci-003", "huggingface.co/gpt2"]:    llm = OpenLM(model=model)    llm_chain = LLMChain(prompt=prompt, llm=llm)    result = llm_chain.run(question)    print(        """Model: {}Result: {}""".format(model, result)    )
```

```
Model: text-davinci-003Result:  France is a country in Europe. The capital of France is Paris.Model: huggingface.co/gpt2Result: Question: What is the capital of France?Answer: Let's think step by step. I am not going to lie, this is a complicated issue, and I don't see any solutions to all this, but it is still far more
```
