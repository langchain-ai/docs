title: "Amazon API Gateway"
---

> [Amazon API Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/) is a fully managed service that makes it easy for developers to create, publish, maintain, monitor, and secure APIs at any >scale. APIs act as the "front door" for applications to access data, business logic, or functionality from your backend services. Using `API Gateway`, you can create RESTful APIs and >WebSocket APIs that enable real-time two-way communication applications. API Gateway supports containerized and serverless workloads, as well as web applications.

> `API Gateway` handles all the tasks involved in accepting and processing up to hundreds of thousands of concurrent API calls, including traffic management, CORS support, authorization >and access control, throttling, monitoring, and API version management. `API Gateway` has no minimum fees or startup costs. You pay for the API calls you receive and the amount of data >transferred out and, with the `API Gateway` tiered pricing model, you can reduce your cost as your API usage scales.
