Traces are a series of steps that your application takes to go from input to output. Each of these individual steps is represented by a run. You can use [LangSmith](https://smith.langchain.com/) to visualize these execution steps. To use it, [enable tracing for your application](/oss/trace-agent). This enables you to do the following:

* [Debug a locally running application](/langgraph-platform/clone-traces-studio).
* [Evaluate the application performance](/oss/evals).
* [Monitor the application](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/observability/how_to_guides/dashboards).

To get started, sign up for a free account at [LangSmith](https://smith.langchain.com/).

## Enable tracing

To enable [tracing](/oss/trace-agent) for your application, set the following environment variables:

```python
export LANGSMITH_TRACING=true
export LANGSMITH_API_KEY=<your-api-key>
```

For more information, see [Trace with LangGraph](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/observability/how_to_guides/trace_with_langgraph).
