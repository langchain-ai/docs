title: "Overview"
---

This guide provides explanations of the key concepts behind the LangChain framework and AI applications more broadly.

We recommend that you go through at least one of the [Tutorials](/src/oss/tutorials) before diving into the conceptual guide. This will provide practical context that will make it easier to understand the concepts discussed here.

The conceptual guide does not cover step-by-step instructions or specific implementation examples â€” those are found in the [How-to guides](/src/oss/how_to) and [Tutorials](/src/oss/tutorials). For detailed reference material, please see the [API reference](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/).

## High level

* **[Why LangChain?](/src/oss/concepts/why_langchain)**: Overview of the value that LangChain provides.
* **[Architecture](/src/oss/concepts/architecture)**: How packages are organized in the LangChain ecosystem.

## Concepts

* **[Chat models](/src/oss/concepts/chat_models)**: LLMs exposed via a chat API that process sequences of messages as input and output a message.
* **[Messages](/src/oss/concepts/messages)**: The unit of communication in chat models, used to represent model input and output.
* **[Chat history](/src/oss/concepts/chat_history)**: A conversation represented as a sequence of messages, alternating between user messages and model responses.
* **[Tools](/src/oss/concepts/tools)**: A function with an associated schema defining the function's name, description, and the arguments it accepts.
* **[Tool calling](/src/oss/concepts/tool_calling)**: A type of chat model API that accepts tool schemas, along with messages, as input and returns invocations of those tools as part of the output message.
* **[Structured output](/src/oss/concepts/structured_outputs)**: A technique to make a chat model respond in a structured format, such as JSON that matches a given schema.
* **[Memory](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/memory/)**: Information about a conversation that is persisted so that it can be used in future conversations.
* **[Multimodality](/src/oss/concepts/multimodality)**: The ability to work with data that comes in different forms, such as text, audio, images, and video.
* **[Runnable interface](/src/oss/concepts/runnables)**: The base abstraction that many LangChain components and the LangChain Expression Language are built on.
* **[Streaming](/src/oss/concepts/streaming)**: LangChain streaming APIs for surfacing results as they are generated.
* **[LangChain Expression Language (LCEL)](/src/oss/concepts/lcel)**: A syntax for orchestrating LangChain components. Most useful for simpler applications.
* **[Document loaders](/src/oss/concepts/document_loaders)**: Load a source as a list of documents.
* **[Retrieval](/src/oss/concepts/retrieval)**: Information retrieval systems can retrieve structured or unstructured data from a datasource in response to a query.
* **[Text splitters](/src/oss/concepts/text_splitters)**: Split long text into smaller chunks that can be individually indexed to enable granular retrieval.
* **[Embedding models](/src/oss/concepts/embedding_models)**: Models that represent data such as text or images in a vector space.
* **[Vector stores](/src/oss/concepts/vectorstores)**: Storage of and efficient search over vectors and associated metadata.
* **[Retriever](/src/oss/concepts/retrievers)**: A component that returns relevant documents from a knowledge base in response to a query.
* **[Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)](/src/oss/concepts/rag)**: A technique that enhances language models by combining them with external knowledge bases.
* **[Agents](/src/oss/concepts/agents)**: Use a [language model](/src/oss/concepts/chat_models) to choose a sequence of actions to take. Agents can interact with external resources via [tool](/src/oss/concepts/tools).
* **[Prompt templates](/src/oss/concepts/prompt_templates)**: Component for factoring out the static parts of a model "prompt" (usually a sequence of messages). Useful for serializing, versioning, and reusing these static parts.
* **[Output parsers](/src/oss/concepts/output_parsers)**: Responsible for taking the output of a model and transforming it into a more suitable format for downstream tasks. Output parsers were primarily useful prior to the general availability of [tool calling](/src/oss/concepts/tool_calling) and [structured outputs](/src/oss/concepts/structured_outputs).
* **[Few-shot prompting](/src/oss/concepts/few_shot_prompting)**: A technique for improving model performance by providing a few examples of the task to perform in the prompt.
* **[Example selectors](/src/oss/concepts/example_selectors)**: Used to select the most relevant examples from a dataset based on a given input. Example selectors are used in few-shot prompting to select examples for a prompt.
* **[Async programming](/src/oss/concepts/async)**: The basics that one should know to use LangChain in an asynchronous context.
* **[Callbacks](/src/oss/concepts/callbacks)**: Callbacks enable the execution of custom auxiliary code in built-in components. Callbacks are used to stream outputs from LLMs in LangChain, trace the intermediate steps of an application, and more.
* **[Tracing](/src/oss/concepts/tracing)**: The process of recording the steps that an application takes to go from input to output. Tracing is essential for debugging and diagnosing issues in complex applications.
* **[Evaluation](/src/oss/concepts/evaluation)**: The process of assessing the performance and effectiveness of AI applications. This involves testing the model's responses against a set of predefined criteria or benchmarks to ensure it meets the desired quality standards and fulfills the intended purpose. This process is vital for building reliable applications.
* **[Testing](/src/oss/concepts/testing)**: The process of verifying that a component of an integration or application works as expected. Testing is essential for ensuring that the application behaves correctly and that changes to the codebase do not introduce new bugs.
