title: LangChain Agent Auth
---
LangChain Agent Auth enables secure access from agents to any other system via OAuth 2.0 credentials. With LangChain Agent Auth, build your agents to securely connect to any system on a person's behalf.

## Overview

LangChain Agent Auth is designed to solve the challenge of secure authentication for autonomous agents. Instead of embedding credentials directly in agent code or requiring manual intervention for each API call, agents can use the OAuth flow to obtain time-limited access tokens for external services.

The system consists of:
- **Authentication Server**: Manages OAuth flows and stores credentials securely
- **Client SDK**: Python library for easy integration with agents

## Installation

Install directly from the wheel file:

For use with LangGraph:
```bash
pip install https://docs.langchain.com/langchain_auth-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl[langgraph]
```

For use without LangGraph:
```bash
pip install https://docs.langchain.com/langchain_auth-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl
```


## Quick Start

### 1. Initialize the Client

```python
from langchain_auth import Client

client = Client(api_key="your-langsmith-api-key")
```

### 2. Set Up OAuth Providers (one time)

Before agents can authenticate, you need to configure an OAuth provider:

```python
# Create GitHub provider
github_provider = await client.create_oauth_provider(
    provider_id="github",
    name="GitHub",
    client_id="your-github-client-id",
    client_secret="your-github-client-secret",
    auth_url="https://github.com/login/oauth/authorize",
    token_url="https://github.com/login/oauth/access_token",
    user_info_url="https://api.github.com/user",
    scopes=["repo"] # Provide one or more scopes you would like to be available for this provider
)
```

### 3. Authenticate from An Agent

The client `authenticate()` API is used to get OAuth tokens from pre-configured providers. On the first call, it takes the caller through an OAuth 2.0 auth flow.

#### In LangGraph Context

By default, tokens will be scoped to the calling agent using the Assistant ID parameter.

```python
auth_result = await client.authenticate(
    provider="github",
    scopes=["repo"],
    user_id="your_user_id" # Any unique identifier to scope this token to the human caller
)

# Or if you'd like a token that can be used by any agent, set agent_scoped=False
auth_result = await client.authenticate(
    provider="github",
    scopes=["repo"],
    user_id="your_user_id",
    agent_scoped=False
)
```

During execution, if authentication is required, the SDK will throw an [interrupt](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/how-tos/human_in_the_loop/add-human-in-the-loop/#pause-using-interrupt). The agent execution pauses and presents the OAuth URL to the user:

After the user completes OAuth authentication and we receive the callback from the provider, they will see the auth success page:

The agent resumes execution from the point it left off. The token can now be used for any API calls. We store and refresh OAuth tokens on our side, meaning any future uses of this service and scope from this user and agent will not require an OAuth flow.

```python
token = auth_result.token
```

#### Outside LangGraph Context

Grab the auth_url and provide it to the user for out-of-band OAuth flow.


```python
# Default: user-scoped token (works for any agent under this user)
auth_result = await client.authenticate(
    provider="github",
    scopes=["repo"],
    user_id="your_user_id"
)

if auth_result.needs_auth:
    print(f"Complete OAuth at: {auth_result.auth_url}")
    # Wait for completion
    completed_auth = await client.wait_for_completion(auth_result.auth_id)
    token = completed_auth.token
else:
    token = auth_result.token
```
