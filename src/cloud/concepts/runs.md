A run is an invocation of an [assistant](assistants). Each run may have its own input, configuration, and metadata, which may affect execution and output of the underlying graph. A run can optionally be executed on a [thread](./threads).

The LangGraph Platform API provides several endpoints for creating and managing runs. See the [API reference](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/cloud/reference/api/api_ref.html#tag/thread-runs/) for more details.
