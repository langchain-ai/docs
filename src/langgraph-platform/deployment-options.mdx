You can [run LangGraph Platform locally for free](/langgraph-platform/local-server) for testing and development. 

## Production deployment

There are 3 main options for deploying with [LangGraph Platform](/langgraph-platform/index):

1. [Cloud SaaS](#cloud-saas)
2. [Hybrid](#hybrid)
3. [Self-Hosted](#self-hosted)

A quick comparison:

|                      | **Cloud SaaS** | **Hybrid** | **Self-Hosted** |
|----------------------|----------------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Description** | All components run in LangChain's cloud | Control plane runs in LangChain's cloud; data plane in your cloud | All components run in your cloud |
| **CI/CD** | Managed internally by platform | Managed externally by you | Managed externally by you |
| **Data/compute residency** | LangChain's cloud | Your cloud | Your cloud |
| **LangSmith compatibility** | Trace to LangSmith SaaS | Trace to LangSmith SaaS | Trace to Self-Hosted LangSmith |
| **[Pricing](https://www.langchain.com/pricing-langgraph-platform)** | Plus | Enterprise | Enterprise |

## Cloud SaaS

The [Cloud SaaS](/langgraph-platform/cloud) deployment option is a fully managed model for deployment where the [control plane](/langgraph-platform/control-plane) and [data plane](/langgraph-platform/data-plane) run in our cloud. This option provides a simple way to deploy and manage your LangGraph Servers.

Connect your GitHub repositories to the platform and deploy your LangGraph Servers from the [control plane UI](/langgraph-platform/control-plane#control-plane-ui). The build process (i.e. CI/CD) is managed internally by the platform.

* [How to deploy to Cloud SaaS](/langgraph-platform/deploy-to-cloud)

## Hybrid

<Info>
  **Important**
  The Hybrid deployment option requires an [Enterprise](/langgraph-platform/plans) plan.
</Info>

The [Hybrid](/langgraph-platform/hybrid) deployment option lets you manage the [data plane](/langgraph-platform/data-plane) in your own cloud, while we handle the [control plane](/langgraph-platform/control-plane) in ours.

Build a Docker image using the [LangGraph CLI](/langgraph-platform/langgraph-cli) and deploy your LangGraph Server from the [control plane UI](/langgraph-platform/control-plane#control-plane-ui).

Supported Compute Platforms: [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/), [Amazon ECS](https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/) (coming soon!)

For more information, please see:

* [Hybrid Conceptual Guide](/langgraph-platform/hybrid)
* [How to deploy the Hybrid](/langgraph-platform/deploy-hybrid)

## Self-Hosted

<Info>
  **Important**
  The Self-Hosted deployment option requires an [Enterprise](/langgraph-platform/plans) plan.
</Info>

The Self-Hosted deployment option allows you to run all components entirely within your own cloud environment.

You can deploy either:

1. **[Full Platform](/langgraph-platform/self-hosted#full-platform)**: Deploy both control plane and data plane with full UI/API management capabilities
2. **[Data Plane Only](/langgraph-platform/self-hosted#data-plane-only)**: Deploy standalone instances of a LangGraph Server without the control plane UI

With the full platform option, build a Docker image using the [LangGraph CLI](/langgraph-platform/langgraph-cli) and deploy your LangGraph Server from the [control plane UI](/langgraph-platform/control-plane#control-plane-ui) or using the container deployment tooling of your choice.

Supported Compute Platforms: [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) (for Control Plane), any compute platform (for Data Plane Only)
