## Free deployment

You can deploy LangGraph Platform for free by running [LangGraph Server locally](/langgraph-platform/local-server) for testing and development. 

## Production deployment

There are 4 main options for deploying with the [LangGraph Platform](/langgraph-platform/index):

1. [Cloud SaaS](#cloud-saas)
2. [Self-Hosted Data Plane](#self-hosted-data-plane)
3. [Self-Hosted Control Plane](#self-hosted-control-plane)
4. [Standalone Container](#standalone-container)

A quick comparison:

|                      | **Cloud SaaS** | **Self-Hosted Data Plane** | **Self-Hosted Control Plane** | **Standalone Container** |
|----------------------|----------------|----------------------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------|
| **[Control plane UI/API](/langgraph-platform/control-plane)** | Yes | Yes | Yes | No |
| **CI/CD** | Managed internally by platform | Managed externally by you | Managed externally by you | Managed externally by you |
| **Data/compute residency** | LangChain's cloud | Your cloud | Your cloud | Your cloud |
| **LangSmith compatibility** | Trace to LangSmith SaaS | Trace to LangSmith SaaS | Trace to Self-Hosted LangSmith | Optional tracing |
| **[Server version compatibility](/langgraph-platform/langgraph-server#server-versions)** | Enterprise | Enterprise | Enterprise | Enterprise |
| **[Pricing](https://www.langchain.com/pricing-langgraph-platform)** | Plus | Enterprise | Enterprise | Developer |

## Cloud SaaS

The [Cloud SaaS](/langgraph-platform/cloud) deployment option is a fully managed model for deployment where we manage the [control plane](/langgraph-platform/control-plane) and [data plane](/langgraph-platform/data-plane) in our cloud. This option provides a simple way to deploy and manage your LangGraph Servers.

Connect your GitHub repositories to the platform and deploy your LangGraph Servers from the [control plane UI](/langgraph-platform/control-plane#control-plane-ui). The build process (i.e. CI/CD) is managed internally by the platform.

## Self-Hosted Data Plane

<Info>
  **Important**
  The Self-Hosted Data Plane deployment option requires an [Enterprise](/langgraph-platform/plans) plan.
</Info>

The [Self-Hosted Data Plane](/langgraph-platform/self-hosted-data-plane) deployment option is a "hybrid" model for deployment where we manage the [control plane](/langgraph-platform/control-plane) in our cloud and you manage the [data plane](/langgraph-platform/data-plane) in your cloud. This option provides a way to securely manage your data plane infrastructure, while offloading control plane management to us.

Build a Docker image using the [LangGraph CLI](langgraph-cli) and deploy your LangGraph Server from the [control plane UI](/langgraph-platform/control-plane#control-plane-ui).

Supported Compute Platforms: [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/), [Amazon ECS](https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/) (coming soon!)

For more information, please see:

* [Self-Hosted Data Plane Conceptual Guide](/langgraph-platform/self-hosted-data-plane)
* [How to deploy the Self-Hosted Data Plane](/langgraph-platform/deploy-self-hosted-data-plane)

## Self-Hosted Control Plane

<Info>
  **Important**
  The Self-Hosted Control Plane deployment option requires an [Enterprise](/langgraph-platform/plans) plan.
</Info>

The [Self-Hosted Control Plane](/langgraph-platform/self-hosted-control-plane) deployment option is a fully self-hosted model for deployment where you manage the [control plane](/langgraph-platform/control-plane) and [data plane](/langgraph-platform/data-plane) in your cloud. This option gives you full control and responsibility of the control plane and data plane infrastructure.

Build a Docker image using the [LangGraph CLI](/langgraph-platform/langgraph-cli) and deploy your LangGraph Server from the [control plane UI](/langgraph-platform/control-plane#control-plane-ui).

Supported Compute Platforms: [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/)

For more information, please see:

* [Self-Hosted Control Plane Conceptual Guide](/langgraph-platform/self-hosted-control-plane)
* [How to deploy the Self-Hosted Control Plane](/langgraph-platform/deploy-self-hosted-control-plane)

## Standalone Container

You can:

- Deploy standalone instances of a LangGraph Server in your cloud.
- Build a Docker image using the [LangGraph CLI](/langgraph-platform/langgraph-cli) and deploy your LangGraph Server using the container deployment tooling of your choice. Images can be deployed to any compute platform.

* [Standalone Container Conceptual Guide](/langgraph-platform/standalone-container)
