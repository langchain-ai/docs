LangGraph Platform offers multiple deployment options to suit different needs and requirements.

You can deploy LangGraph Platform for free by running [LangGraph Server locally](/langgraph-platform/local-server) for testing and development.

## Deployment Options Overview

There are 4 main options for deploying with the [LangGraph Platform](/langgraph-platform/index):

| **Feature** | **Cloud SaaS** | **Self-Hosted Data Plane** | **Self-Hosted Control Plane** | **Standalone Container** |
|-------------|----------------|----------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Managed Control Plane** | Yes | Yes | No | No |
| **Managed Data Plane** | Yes | No | No | No |
| **[Control plane UI/API](/langgraph-platform/control-plane)** | Yes | Yes | Yes | No |
| **Enterprise Features** | Yes | Yes | Yes | No |
| **Self-Hosted** | No | Partial | Yes | Yes |

## Cloud SaaS

The [Cloud SaaS](/langgraph-platform/cloud) deployment option is a fully managed model for deployment where we manage the [control plane](/langgraph-platform/control-plane) and [data plane](/langgraph-platform/data-plane) in our cloud. This option provides a simple, managed experience with minimal setup and maintenance.

## Self-Hosted Data Plane

The Self-Hosted Data Plane deployment option requires an [Enterprise](/langgraph-platform/plans) plan.

The [Self-Hosted Data Plane](/langgraph-platform/self-hosted-data-plane) deployment option is a "hybrid" model for deployment where we manage the [control plane](/langgraph-platform/control-plane) in our cloud and you manage the [data plane](/langgraph-platform/data-plane) in your infrastructure.

Build a Docker image using the [LangGraph CLI](/langgraph-platform/langgraph-cli) and deploy your LangGraph Server from the [control plane UI](/langgraph-platform/control-plane#control-plane-ui).

## Self-Hosted Control Plane

The Self-Hosted Control Plane deployment option requires an [Enterprise](/langgraph-platform/plans) plan.

The [Self-Hosted Control Plane](/langgraph-platform/self-hosted-control-plane) deployment option is a fully self-hosted model for deployment where you manage the [control plane](/langgraph-platform/control-plane) and [data plane](/langgraph-platform/data-plane) in your infrastructure.

Build a Docker image using the [LangGraph CLI](/langgraph-platform/langgraph-cli) and deploy your LangGraph Server from the [control plane UI](/langgraph-platform/control-plane#control-plane-ui).

* [How to deploy the Self-Hosted Control Plane](/langgraph-platform/deploy-self-hosted-control-plane)

## Standalone Container

The Standalone Container deployment option is a fully self-hosted model for deployment where you manage everything in your infrastructure.

- Build a Docker image using the [LangGraph CLI](/langgraph-platform/langgraph-cli) and deploy your LangGraph Server using the container deployment tooling of your choice. Images can be deployed to any compute platform.
