title: Invalid License
---

## Overview

If you're seeing an "Invalid License" error, it means your LangGraph Platform deployment is missing a valid license key.

## Solutions

### For Local Development

If you're running locally and seeing this error, you can:

1. Use the development server which doesn't require a license:
   ```bash
   langgraph dev
   ```

2. See the [local server](/langgraph-platform/local-server) docs for more information.

### For Production Deployments

If you're deploying to production and seeing this error:

1. **Cloud SaaS**: If you would like a fast managed environment, consider the [Cloud SaaS](/langgraph-platform/cloud) deployment option. This requires no additional license key.

2. **Self-Hosted**: For self-hosted deployments, you need to obtain a license key from LangChain.

3. **Standalone Container**: The standalone container deployment option doesn't require a license key.

## Next Steps

For more information on deployment options and their features, see the [Deployment Options](/langgraph-platform/deployment-options) documentation.
