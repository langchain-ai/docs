title: Self-Hosted Data Plane
---

There are two versions of the self-hosted deployment: [Self-Hosted Data Plane](/langgraph-platform/deployment-options#self-hosted-data-plane) and [Self-Hosted Control Plane](/langgraph-platform/deployment-options#self-hosted-control-plane).

## Overview

The Self-Hosted Data Plane deployment option requires an [Enterprise](/langgraph-platform/plans) plan.

## Prerequisites

* You use `langgraph-cli` and/or [LangGraph Studio](/langgraph-platform/langgraph-studio) app to test graph locally.

## Architecture

The [Self-Hosted Data Plane](/langgraph-platform/deploy-self-hosted-data-plane) deployment option is a "hybrid" model for deployment where we manage the [control plane](/langgraph-platform/control-plane) in our cloud and you manage the [data plane](/langgraph-platform/data-plane) in your infrastructure.

|                   | [Control plane](/langgraph-platform/control-plane) | [Data plane](/langgraph-platform/data-plane) |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **Managed by**    | LangChain                                         | You                                           |
| **Infrastructure**| LangChain's cloud                                 | Your infrastructure                            |

For information on how to deploy a [LangGraph Server](/langgraph-platform/langgraph-server) to Self-Hosted Data Plane, see [Deploy to Self-Hosted Data Plane](/langgraph-platform/deploy-self-hosted-data-plane)

## Supported Compute Platforms

* [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/)
* [Amazon ECS](https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/) (coming soon!)
