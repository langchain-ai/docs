title: Self-hosted data plane
---

There are two versions of the self-hosted deployment: [Self-Hosted Data Plane](/langgraph-platform/deployment-options#self-hosted-data-plane) and [Self-Hosted Control Plane](/langgraph-platform/deployment-options#self-hosted-control-plane).

<Info>
  **Important**
  The Self-Hosted Data Plane deployment option requires an [Enterprise](/langgraph-platform/plans) plan.
</Info>

## Requirements

* You use `langgraph-cli` and/or [LangGraph Studio](/langgraph-platform/langgraph-studio) app to test graph locally.
* You use `langgraph build` command to build image.

## Self-Hosted Data Plane

The [Self-Hosted Data Plane](/langgraph-platform/deploy-self-hosted-data-plane) deployment option is a "hybrid" model for deployment where we manage the [control plane](/langgraph-platform/control-plane) in our cloud and you manage the [data plane](/langgraph-platform/data-plane) in your cloud. This option provides a way to securely manage your data plane infrastructure, while offloading control plane management to us. When using the Self-Hosted Data Plane version, you authenticate with a [LangSmith](https://smith.langchain.com/) API key.

| **What is it?** | <ul><li>Control plane UI for creating deployments and revisions</li><li>Control plane APIs for creating deployments and revisions</li></ul> | <ul><li>Data plane "listener" for reconciling deployments with control plane state</li><li>LangGraph Servers</li><li>Postgres, Redis, etc</li></ul> |
| **Where is it hosted?** | LangChain's cloud | Your cloud |
| **Who provisions and manages it?** | LangChain | You |

### Compute Platforms

* **Kubernetes**: The Self-Hosted Data Plane deployment option supports deploying data plane infrastructure to any Kubernetes cluster.
* **Amazon ECS**: Coming soon!

<Tip>
  If you would like to deploy to Kubernetes, you can follow the [Self-Hosted Data Plane deployment guide](/langgraph-platform/deploy-self-hosted-data-plane).
