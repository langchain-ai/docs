## Free deployment

There are two free options for deploying LangGraph applications via the LangGraph Server:

1. [Local](local-server): Deploy for local testing and development. 
2. [Standalone Container (Lite)](langgraph_standalone_container): A limited version of Standalone Container for deployments unlikely to see more that 1 million node executions per year and that do not need crons and other enterprise features. Standalone Container (Lite) deployment option is free with a LangSmith API key.

## Production deployment

There are 4 main options for deploying with the [LangGraph Platform](langgraph_platform):

1. [Cloud SaaS](#cloud-saas)
2. [Self-Hosted Data Plane](#self-hosted-data-plane)
3. [Self-Hosted Control Plane](#self-hosted-control-plane)
4. [Standalone Container](#standalone-container)

A quick comparison:

|                      | **Cloud SaaS** | **Self-Hosted Data Plane** | **Self-Hosted Control Plane** | **Standalone Container** |
|----------------------|----------------|----------------------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------|
| **[Control plane UI/API](langgraph_control_plane)** | Yes | Yes | Yes | No |
| **CI/CD** | Managed internally by platform | Managed externally by you | Managed externally by you | Managed externally by you |
| **Data/compute residency** | LangChain's cloud | Your cloud | Your cloud | Your cloud |
| **LangSmith compatibility** | Trace to LangSmith SaaS | Trace to LangSmith SaaS | Trace to Self-Hosted LangSmith | Optional tracing |
| **[Server version compatibility](langgraph_server#server-versions)** | Enterprise | Enterprise | Enterprise | Lite, Enterprise |
| **[Pricing](https://www.langchain.com/pricing-langgraph-platform)** | Plus | Enterprise | Enterprise | Developer |

## Cloud SaaS

The [Cloud SaaS](langgraph_cloud) deployment option is a fully managed model for deployment where we manage the [control plane](langgraph_control_plane) and [data plane](langgraph_data_plane) in our cloud. This option provides a simple way to deploy and manage your LangGraph Servers.

Connect your GitHub repositories to the platform and deploy your LangGraph Servers from the [control plane UI](langgraph_control_plane#control-plane-ui). The build process (i.e. CI/CD) is managed internally by the platform.

## Self-Hosted Data Plane

<Info>
  **Important**
  The Self-Hosted Data Plane deployment option requires an [Enterprise](plans) plan.
</Info>

The [Self-Hosted Data Plane](langgraph_self_hosted_data_plane) deployment option is a "hybrid" model for deployment where we manage the [control plane](langgraph_control_plane) in our cloud and you manage the [data plane](langgraph_data_plane) in your cloud. This option provides a way to securely manage your data plane infrastructure, while offloading control plane management to us.

Build a Docker image using the [LangGraph CLI](langgraph_cli) and deploy your LangGraph Server from the [control plane UI](langgraph_control_plane#control-plane-ui).

Supported Compute Platforms: [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/), [Amazon ECS](https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/) (coming soon!)

* [How to deploy the Self-Hosted Data Plane](self_hosted_data_plane)

## Self-Hosted Control Plane

<Info>
  **Important**
  The Self-Hosted Control Plane deployment option requires an [Enterprise](plans) plan.
</Info>

The [Self-Hosted Control Plane](langgraph_self_hosted_control_plane) deployment option is a fully self-hosted model for deployment where you manage the [control plane](langgraph_control_plane) and [data plane](langgraph_data_plane) in your cloud. This option gives you full control and responsibility of the control plane and data plane infrastructure.

Build a Docker image using the [LangGraph CLI](langgraph_cli) and deploy your LangGraph Server from the [control plane UI](langgraph_control_plane#control-plane-ui).

Supported Compute Platforms: [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/)

For more information, please see:

* [Self-Hosted Control Plane Conceptual Guide](langgraph_self_hosted_control_plane)
* [How to deploy the Self-Hosted Control Plane](self_hosted_control_plane)

## Standalone Container

The [Standalone Container](langgraph_standalone_container) deployment option is the least restrictive model for deployment. Deploy standalone instances of a LangGraph Server in your cloud, using any of the [available](plans) license options.

Build a Docker image using the [LangGraph CLI](langgraph_cli) and deploy your LangGraph Server using the container deployment tooling of your choice. Images can be deployed to any compute platform.
