LangGraph Platform consists of several key components that work together to provide a complete solution for deploying and managing agentic applications:

* [LangGraph Server](/langgraph-platform/langgraph-server): The server defines an opinionated API and architecture that incorporates best practices for deploying agentic applications, allowing you to focus on building your agent logic rather than developing server infrastructure.
* [LangGraph CLI](/langgraph-platform/langgraph-cli): LangGraph CLI is a command-line interface that helps to interact with a local LangGraph.
* [LangGraph Studio](/langgraph-platform/langgraph-studio): LangGraph Studio is a specialized IDE that can connect to a LangGraph Server to enable visualization, interaction, and debugging of the application locally.
* [Python/JS SDK](/langgraph-platform/sdk): The Python/JS SDK provides a programmatic way to interact with deployed LangGraph Applications.
* [Remote Graph](/langgraph-platform/use-remote-graph): A RemoteGraph allows you to interact with any deployed LangGraph application as though it were running locally.
* [LangGraph Control Plane](/langgraph-platform/control-plane): The LangGraph Control Plane refers to the Control Plane UI where users create and update LangGraph Servers and the Control Plane APIs that support the UI experience.
* [LangGraph Data Plane](/langgraph-platform/data-plane): The LangGraph Data Plane refers to LangGraph Servers, the corresponding infrastructure for each server, and the "listener" application that continuously polls for updates from the LangGraph Control Plane.
