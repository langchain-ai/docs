LangGraph Platform supports OpenAPI security schemes that enable automatic client generation. See the [Authentication & Access Control conceptual guide](/langgraph-platform/auth) for more details about LangGraph's authentication system.

This guide only covers how to document your security requirements in OpenAPI. To implement the actual authentication logic, see [How to add custom authentication](/langgraph-platform/custom-auth).

## Overview

When you deploy a LangGraph application with custom authentication, the platform automatically generates OpenAPI documentation that includes your security requirements. This enables tools like [OpenAPI Generator](https://openapi-generator.tech/) to create type-safe client libraries that handle authentication automatically.

## Security Schemes

LangGraph Platform supports the following OpenAPI security schemes:

### Bearer Token Authentication

The most common authentication method is Bearer token authentication. When you implement custom authentication, the platform automatically adds a `bearerAuth` security scheme to your OpenAPI documentation.

```yaml
components:
  securitySchemes:
    bearerAuth:
      type: http
      scheme: bearer
      bearerFormat: JWT
```

### API Key Authentication

For API key authentication, you can specify the location and name of the API key:

```yaml
components:
  securitySchemes:
    apiKeyAuth:
      type: apiKey
      in: header
      name: X-API-Key
```

## Applying Security to Endpoints

You can apply security schemes to specific endpoints or globally to all endpoints. To add custom authentication, see [How to add custom authentication](/langgraph-platform/custom-auth).

## Example

Here's an example of how security is applied to endpoints in the generated OpenAPI documentation:

```yaml
paths:
  /threads/{thread_id}/runs:
    post:
      security:
        - bearerAuth: []
      # ... other endpoint details
```

This indicates that the endpoint requires Bearer token authentication. To add custom authentication, see [How to add custom authentication](/langgraph-platform/custom-auth).
