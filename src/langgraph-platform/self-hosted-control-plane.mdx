title: Self-hosted control plane
---
There are two versions of the self-hosted deployment: [Self-Hosted Data Plane](deployment-options#self-hosted-data-plane) and [Self-Hosted Control Plane](deployment-options#self-hosted-control-plane).

<Info>
  **Important**
  The Self-Hosted Control Plane deployment option requires an [Enterprise](plans) plan.
</Info>

## Requirements

* You use `langgraph-cli` and/or [LangGraph Studio](langgraph-studio) app to test graph locally.
* You use `langgraph build` command to build image.
* You have a Self-Hosted LangSmith instance deployed.
* You are using Ingress for your LangSmith instance. All agents will be deployed as Kubernetes services behind this ingress.

## Self-Hosted Control Plane

The [Self-Hosted Control Plane](self-hosted-control-plane) deployment option is a fully self-hosted model for deployment where you manage the [control plane](control-plane) and [data plane](data-plane) in your cloud. This option gives you full control and responsibility of the control plane and data plane infrastructure.

| **What is it?** | <ul><li>Control plane UI for creating deployments and revisions</li><li>Control plane APIs for creating deployments and revisions</li></ul> | <ul><li>Data plane "listener" for reconciling deployments with control plane state</li><li>LangGraph Servers</li><li>Postgres, Redis, etc</li></ul> |

### Compute Platforms

* **Kubernetes**: The Self-Hosted Control Plane deployment option supports deploying control plane and data plane infrastructure to any Kubernetes cluster.

<Tip>
  If you would like to enable this on your LangSmith instance, please follow the [Self-Hosted Control Plane deployment guide](deploy-self-hosted-control-plane).
