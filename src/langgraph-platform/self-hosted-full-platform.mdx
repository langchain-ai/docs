title: Self-hosted full platform
---
There are two versions of the self-hosted deployment: [Self-Hosted Data Plane](/langgraph-platform/deployment-options#self-hosted-data-plane) and [Self-Hosted Full Platform](/langgraph-platform/deployment-options#self-hosted-full-platform).

<Info>
  **Important**
  The Self-Hosted Full Platform deployment option requires an [Enterprise](/langgraph-platform/plans) plan.
</Info>

## Requirements

* You use `langgraph-cli` and/or [LangGraph Studio](/langgraph-platform/langgraph-studio) app to test graph locally.
* You use `langgraph build` command to build image.
* You have a Self-Hosted LangSmith instance deployed.
* You are using Ingress for your LangSmith instance. All agents will be deployed as Kubernetes services behind this ingress.

## Self-Hosted Full Platform

The [Self-Hosted Full Platform](/langgraph-platform/self-hosted-full-platform) deployment option is a fully self-hosted model for deployment where you manage the [control plane](/langgraph-platform/control-plane) and [data plane](/langgraph-platform/data-plane) in your cloud. This option gives you full control and responsibility of the control plane and data plane infrastructure.

| **What is it?** | <ul><li>Control plane UI for creating deployments and revisions</li><li>Control plane APIs for creating deployments and revisions</li></ul> | <ul><li>Data plane "listener" for reconciling deployments with control plane state</li><li>LangGraph Servers</li><li>Postgres, Redis, etc</li></ul> |
