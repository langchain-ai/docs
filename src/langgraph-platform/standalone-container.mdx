title: Standalone container
---

To deploy a [LangGraph Server](langgraph-server), follow the how-to guide for [how to deploy a Standalone Container](deploy-standalone-container).

## Overview

The Standalone Container deployment option is the least restrictive model for deployment. There is no [control plane](control-plane). [Data plane](data-plane) infrastructure is managed by you.

|                   | [Control plane](control-plane) | [Data plane](data-plane) |
|-------------------|-------------------|------------|
| **What is it?** | n/a | <ul><li>LangGraph Servers</li><li>Postgres, Redis, etc</li></ul> |
| **Where is it hosted?** | n/a | Your cloud |
| **Who provisions and manages it?** | n/a | You |

<Warning>
  LangGraph Platform should not be deployed in serverless environments. Scale to zero may cause task loss and scaling up will not work reliably.
</Warning>
